First, check in was late for 45mins. Everyone who check in later then us get their room. Was told the room is still cleaning in progress and that other customers room are different. How different can a Deluxe and Premier room be that they need longer time to clean. Though Manager offer complimentary dine-in and late check out as part of compensation, the food is ONLY Warm and not hot for Steak and Lobster Roll. As breakfast is no longer in buffet style, I understand the slight delay in serving. However, got to wait another 40 mins for a bowl of laska is unacceptable.

I enjoyed the Heritage Brunch very much and decided to visit again last Sunday with my Husband. It was his first time. The food quality and ambience is always a five star experience but this visit of mine turned into a six star visit due to the attentiveness by F&B colleague, Ms Charisma.
She has been very accommodating to our needs, constantly checking our table if we needed extra food and even took initiative to introduce the Preferred membership to me. Her every visit to our table was very consistent yet not robotic. She made us feel very exclusive and this is what the Clifford Pier dining experience should be like. Before I left the restaurant, I even took the initiative to ask for means on how to write a review for Charisma. Well done and keep up the good work there!

The Suite was impeccably furnished and maintained and was very spacious. It came with a separate living area, king-sized bed, and a bathtub (with its own television). The outstanding thing about the room are its eye-catching views of the Marina Bay.
I strongly recommend a visit to the outdoor rooftop pool at night to relax and soak up the fantastic night views of the skyline.
Service throughout the hotel was excellent as well. A special shoutout to Amanda, who took good care of us and even arranged for some gifts when she found out that we were celebrating a special occasion at the hotel. Its things like these that set the exceptional hotels apart from the others.

Upon arrival was greeted by Oliver who brought us to the check in counter. He was polite and very pleasant. Check in was such a breeze and all things had been sorted out. Love the fact that the hotel had earlier emailed a form to ask for our time preference for breakfast and use of pool. Was then escorted to our Premier Bayview room and love the room for its amazing view! Had tea in our room and I had earlier informed the F&B team of our dietary requirements. They were prompt in getting back to our request, thanks team F&B! We had a great time at the pool too and were served with ice water, not just once. Thank you Maria who was at the pool and for being attentive to our needs. Had inroom dining for dinner and again was satisfied with our food and service. Similarly, breakfast was just as good and thanks to all who had served us, Hannie and team. Before leaving, took a walk around the hotel vicinity to admire the beautiful architecture and Oliver as there to share some information about the building, definitely made our day.

Amanda from the front desk helped us secure times for our meals, pool, and gymnasium, per the COVID regulations. And when we arrived and our room was not quite ready, both her and her colleague, Vanessa, handled it well, having us enjoy a complimentary cocktail (with no ""asking management"", which is great because it makes a situation like that flawless because they are empowered, a very good move by the management) and then dropping nice things by our room a couple of times during our stay. We also had excellent breakfast service from Emma at the Landing Dock. The room with the bay view on the 5th floor (highly recommended to take this upgrade and room 516) had a wonderful view, was spacious, and had a nice terrace (minor recommendation: put two chairs out there instead of one) and very comfortable.
The pool is excellent and for our stay, it was quieter than usual, as the Lantern bar is still closed as of this writing, and the general public can come to this bar, which changes the vibe of the pool in more normal times. This was much more private and meant we could enjoy the facilities well, as we were craving that quiet.
All in all, an excellent experience and we were very happy to support this hotel in a very difficult time for the industry, and hope to again. Thanks to all for such flawless personalized service!",Date of stay: October 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Raffles,,

Overall, everything was fantastic, and the service of the staff made it especially memorable. Special mention to Wendy, our wedding coordinator and Benedict, the banquet manager for an overall job well done and prompt reassurance of our concerns. From late night last minute calls to sudden changes, she was friendly and professional throughout. She was also quick to catch on to our needs and assisted us where needed. On the day itself, Benedict was also attentive to the overall flow of events and needs of the guests. Food made by chef Liang of jade restaurant was also exceptional, our guests all enjoyed the food. One minor bone to pick - perhaps due to regulation changes, we were not informed that our reception needed to take temperature of guests. This did cause some confusion but in the grand scheme of things, was acceptable.
For the stay, the loft suite was abit dated. It is probably meant for more old school folks or those that prefer a living space and a balcony with a view to chill and relax. You do need to be able to climb stairs though. The toilet also did not have a bidet, something that I truly missed. The curtain controls were also very well worn, and could do with a refresh. However, cleanliness was impeccable and the amenities were lovely.
Depsite this, I much preferred the premier courtyard room which was much more modern. It came with heated toilet bowl and a bidet and controls were much more updated and new. Only point to note is that the windows open up to the courtyard, so if you are looking for privacy, be sure to draw the curtains.
Finally, everything that tied it together was the service of the staff. They all knew we were celebrating our wedding and went about their jobs cheerfully and attentively. Even if we felt our requests were trivial, they didnt scoff at it and respected it. Full marks for service staff which made our stay extremely enjoyable.
Would definitely recommend to consider for weddings and staycations.",Date of stay: November 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Raffles,,

When we entered our room, there’s a piece of cake and note wishing my partner happy birthday. I noticed cigarette smell but was told that it’s non smoking room. Their room service lady came over with refresher and made another trip to our room with filter, just so ensure the smell will to gone. Their excellent service didn’t stop there, kate, their duty manager find another room and offer to change for us. When we decided to stay at our current room, she specially made 2 cups of hot honey lemon for us, hoping it helps a little with my sensitive nose. She wants us to enjoy our stay at Fullerton.
Next morning, Abigael, the waitress who serve us during our breakfast also took the effort in wishing my partner and commented how nice it is to see us return after holding our banquet at Fullerton years ago.
After we check out, we decided to try their high tea at courtyard but we were a little late, an hour before they close their high tea session. We met Lalikumar, the waiter who did all he can to ensure we don’t feel pressure or have to rush through the high tea session, he wants us to enjoy the session. He took initiative to recommend drinks for us, pay extra attention to our table and secretly extend the last order for us. Before he leaves, he specially asked his colleague, Albert to take care of us! How thoughtful!
Abigael, who is helping out at courtyard, recognised us. She walked over and surprise us with a piece of cake and wishes my partner happy birthday again! How sweet of her!

We opt for the Premier Collyer Suite as Palladin was fully booked, the front office team did a superb job in checking us in. Honourable mentions to the double Kate team, especially Ms Kate Reyes and Ms. Kate Mungkeong, they were professional and very attentive to details, they ensure and kept us updated for all our pool booking, breakfast, and checkouts.
We had the pleasure of The Straits Club team who served us during our stay. Ms. Norish, Mr Paolo, Mr. Kenneth, and Ms. Chia Yi were amazing, they made sure that we felt welcomed and had everything in order, despite the extra attention and service steps they have to go through to serve the guest during this COVID time the team really took the effort to make every guest feel welcome.
The Banquet team, I would like to personally give thanks to Mr. Nicklaus and Mr. Jason for making my friend’s wedding a perfect experience for everyone, their coordination and ensuring the function runs smoothly must also be commended, I will happily recommend any of my friends to book their function here.
Town Restaurant Morning breakfast amazing attention by Mr. Steve must be noted as well. He noticed my little daughter wasn’t eating well and he recommended a pancake specially made for her as there was no kid-friendly menu. Ms. Annie was attentive at breakfast as well.
Not forgetting the Bell captains, Mr. Nazri, Mr. Li Yang, and Mr. Rafi for making our visit a pleasurable moment. They are very helpful and always ensure that greeting the guest is their priority.
Last but not least, to Mr. Giovanni Viterale whom we briefly met in the lobby, I have to say that you are running a very good team in Fullerton hotel, your vision in providing everyone a safe place with cleaning and sanitizing the hotel on every corner and aspect makes us feel safe and secure.

Classic heritage hotel, in my staycation list.
Always been to fullerton for their dinner buffet. My fav, fullerton laksa! The staffs are always friendly and polite.
Had a memorable birthday at Fullerton.
My partner had requested no birthday cake in order not to waste food. So I was in a norm mode to enter the room.
A sweet and simple surprise by Fullerton team. Upon check-in, we were being upgraded to Quay room.
The room was clean and decorated with colorful HBD balloons. The view was great in the day and night for me to take awe pics!
Due to covid, breakfast is provided in a set. Thanksful for understanding staffs, I had 2nd share and of cos I finished it.
The portion per set is just nice. Suggest if you cant finish 2nd portion then really dont order it.
The only way I can thank all the staffs is to acknowledge their teamworks and efforts.
Please take care and hope to stay again! Thank you so much.",Date of stay: November 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Raffles,,

The Fullerton Hotel Singapore,Crusader bug,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/crusaderbug,"Singapore, Singapore",Crusader bug wrote a review Oct 2020,23 contributions,Hot water surprise,"This is the second time we were staycationing at the Fullerton Hotel.
We stayed in a suite in August this year, when We dined at the hotel’s excellent Jade restaurant. We enjoyed that stay tremendously.
Aah! But the test of a hotel’s excellence is how the hotel treats the guests of its ordinary rooms.
We booked into the Courtyard room quite late on a Saturday afternoon.
We went out for dinner to return about 8.30 pm, to find hot water coming out of both the cold and hot water taps in the bathroom sink!
Naturally, the hotel reception hardly believed us; hot water from the cold water tap?!; perhaps, we were those troublesome guests agitating for a free upgrade. They send a technician to our room to confirm our plumbing complaints.
We were bumped up to a slightly larger Heritage room, our nightly ablutions and repose hindered temporarily. The staff were very apologetic to have inconvenienced us.
The service was as good as when we staying in the suite during our August staycation. Definitely better than most other hotels.
I would have love to give Fullerton Hotel 5 stars overall. However, small details nudged it down to 4 stars: the plumbing and disposable masks. Masks were freely available for guests in the suite, whereas room guests have to request for them. Aiyoh! How much do disposable masks cost? Why this small but obvious discrepancy between suites and ordinary rooms? The virus doesn’t discriminate between guests.
Overall, it had been a pleasurable stay. We may return for another staycation. I would recommend Fullerton to others. Still ranks well among the hotels I stayed.",Date of stay: October 2020,,4,,,,,,,,Raffles,,

Room was of course spacious, 2 levels and the balcony had a good view of the bay area. However, it seemed to be in need of refurbishment. Aircon was too cold, even at the lowest fan setting. Sofa bed was about to give way, the springs were very flimsy.
Service was rather mediocre. Went at 2 p.m. for the welcome drinks at the courtyard but was told they are preparing for afternoon tea due to start at 2:30 p.m. Went back about 9 p.m. but was ""encouraged"" to takeaway. The so-called signature Merlion cocktails came in paper cups and apparently they gave the non-alcoholic version, wrongly. Having cocktails also entailed the right experience, presentation and service. Paper cups was definitely not to standards.
Even the butler service wasn't great. Asking for the cocktails to be served in-room also wasn't granted. So what's the point of staying in suite when simple and reasonable guest requests couldn't even be accommodated?
For breakfast, our table wasn't cleaned properly. There was spilt milk on the floor and chair. It's rather surprising given the emphasis on cleanliness during this COVID period.
Probably the club lounge was the saving grace. They served good afternoon tea and evening canapes. Service there was good too.",Date of stay: September 2020,,2,,,,,,,,Raffles,,

Shangri-La Singapore is a ""SG CLEAN"" hotel and they do really follow the SG CLEAN Standard and do all the cleaning time to time which I can see Housekeeping department always cleaning around. Social Distancing practice also very strict at here and Hand Sanitiser Machines are all around the hotel too. So no need to be panic or worry that the hotel didn't do the cleaning properly. Well done Shangri-La Singapore!
I have contacted to Shangri-La Singapore earlier to arrange all the surprise arrangement for my wife birthday and all the arrangements went smoothly and perfect! From our arrival until departure, all the dining periods, Chi Spa period and all the rest, we both enjoyed so much and we LOVE it! I personally would like to thank you to Mica Villasenor, without her, I think I will be worry so much on all the surprise arrangement! Thank you Mica Villasenor!

My favourite feature of course is it's luxurious buffet spread for breakfast which I look froward to every morning. I would recommend this hotel in cities like Shanghai (overlooking the Pudong River and near to the Bund), Tokyo, Sydney (at the Rocks), Rasa Sayang Penang, and of course the Shangri-la at Orange Grove Road in Singapore. Recently, I had some hiccups with my Golden Circle membership, and I wrote in to seek its resolution.

1. Informed hotel I'll be celabrating my birthday when reserving room sometime in Sept /Oct 2020. Was promised by reservations team through email that a 250gm cake would be prepared & the team even confirmed the celebrant name. Was looking forward to this staycation. However, promise was not fulfilled. Called service center around 6.30pm on 6 Nov 2020 to find out if the cake is coming. Recived a snide reply that the hotel is having many celabrations & they have noted the request. Wait wait wait, no cake at all. I'm not hard up for the free cake & I do not celebrate birthday after the actual day. What dissapoints me is the unfulfilled promise, in addition to the snide remark from service centre on 6 Nov 2020 @ around 6.30pm.
2. Arrived in the room on 5 Nov 2020. 3 Beds prepared - I booked for 3 Adults. Towels & bedroom slippers only 2 sets & no shower ammenities provided. Had to call service center to ask for an additional set. I find this unacceptable for a 5 star hotel. Shouldn't such toiletries and ammenties be prepared before the guests arrives? I paid for 3 adults.
3. Milky water coming out of tap on day of checkin. Having stayed in many hotels around the world, this is the 1st time I've seen this sort of water issue, especially in SG. Isn't the tap water save for drinking directly? Was only informed from maintainence team that water tank cleaning was ongoing & info was passed to front office. This was not made known to me when I checked in. Lack of communication between the departments. A shocking experience, since this is SG. It took the engineer almost 2 hours to resolve, by running all the taps. Waste water, given SG is water scarce. So happened Guest Relations Officer, Suzana Tsuji called to find out about the room & water issue was reported. She promised to give 10 additional bottles of mineral water everyday for our stay. So 10 bottles of water came on 5 Nov 2020. Then 6 Nov 2020 only supplied with 4 bottles. Again an overpromise & lack of communication among the departments. I guess the Hotel not able to cope with full capacity of guest. I had to buy mineral water from supermarket for my stay at Shangri-La Singapore.
I've stayed in Shangri-la's Rasa Sentosa Resort multilpe times since I was 4 years old. I would say the service & hospitality from Rasa Sentosa is way much better than that of Shangri-La Singapore.
An utter dissapointment from the service provided by Shangri-La Singapore. Only reason that I might consider returning if borders still remain closed, would be that this is the only hotel that allows 3 adults in a room. The other saving grace for this hotel is the cleaniness of the guest room. But then again, Shangri-La Singapore would only bring back dissapointing memories to me for their unfulfilled promises.",Date of stay: November 2020,,1,,,,,,,,Orchard,,

This hotel was allotted to me by the Singapore government for quarantining on my arrival to Singapore.
Initially I was a bit apprehensive before I moved to my room as there were certain protocols and safety measures which the hotel staff had to abide by.
Once I entered my room I was mesmerised by the size of the room. The hotel has very comfortable, subtle styled and aesthetically built rooms with huge space which is beyond reality for a staycation room in a hotel in Singapore.
As I was not allowed to step out of the room due to the quarantine guidelines, this room had to be my home for 14 days. And yes it was, I was moved by the panoramic view from the room of the city around with clouds passing by my window and used to spend my complete day sitting here, having coffee, reading, having a drink, working out while gazing through the enormously big glass windows.
Though the hotel staff was not allowed to interact with us personally,, but they made a way out to communicate with good gestures by sending a personalised video link with meals specially made for the people quarantining here to cheer them up.
The quarantining days could not have been better with the stupendous care of the hotel staff and their hospitality in every possible manner. For instance, they used to take special care of my meals and used to customise them within their limits. Not only this they also had organised an exclusive menu for the people quarantining which was much more economical and healthier than to order from outside if required. To add further, once I require something from a pharmacy and they managed to get it delivered for me on their own without any hassle and that too in very less time.
The incident that made me write this review and made me feel so good about them was this one. I stayed here alone and had my anniversary on Nov 5, and I requested for a dessert and a candle to light a day before but they had their limits of not providing a candle in the room because of safety concerns so I cancelled the dessert. It was out of nowhere when next morning they did send me an anniversary cake with the hand written card to wish me on my anniversary day and it felt so good that they remembered the day though they were not supposed to.
Once again, I would like to humbly thank the hotel staff, house keeping people and the in-room dining people for their immense support and motivation in these days. God bless u all.",Date of stay: November 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Orchard,,

Furthermore, every single staff whom walked past did not even offer to clear the dirty napkins either. 20 minutes later, the tea bag is still laying on the carpet and the spillage remains on the ground, not cleared.
On top of that, the service was pretty slow where staff ain’t that proactive as it was before the pandemic. Our table was so cramped and messy to the extent where no space at all which resulted in the spillage of the tea.

From the get go, we were made to feel less important. We arrived at 3pm, and while everyone else who arrived the same time seemed able to get a room, we were made to wait almost another hour. When we finally got our room, our bags were misplaced. We had to call housekeeping and repeatedly describe the colour of our bags to various individuals. This was extremely annoying given that our 2 toddlers (2year old and 1 year old) were already cranky and in desperate need of a diaper change and sleep.
Things got worse when we arrived at The Line for dinner. While all the expatriate guests ahead of us were greeted and ushered in with a smile, we were rudely ""greeted"" with a ""yes? Safe Entry there"" by the restaurant staff. Thereafter, the same male attendant proceeded to keep speaking to us in Chinese (as if we could not understand English). This behaviour was extremely belittling and annoying and only stopped when we snapped at him several times to speak in English please!!
Post dinner when we arrived back at our room, we discovered large black ants crawling around the floor and windows. When we called housekeeping, they offered to get pest control in the next day but were unable to offer any advice or help to control the situation immediately. My husband had to spend a good half hour killing and getting rid of the pests himself. There was NO follow up by the hotel the next day.
Horridly, the room had no bin liners (which is a terrible inconvenience for guests with babies who have dirty diapers) and we had to keep disposing of the diapers outside the room ourselves.
The final straw would be the utter lack of attention by the staff in general to our family. We noticed that at the poolside, hotel staff were quick to hand out cups of water to expatriate guests who were just talking and mingling poolside. They were delighted of course, while our family of four were just asked rather rudely 'are you leaving?'.
When we were departing, the hotel staff had zero initiative to even open the door for me while I was handling both luggage and toddler. But of course, they sprinted ahead when they saw a fully grown expatriate man walk to the door after.
We had a terrible experience from a supposedly 5 star hotel, and made to feel like outsiders in our own country. Shame on you Shangri-la.",Date of stay: October 2020,,1,,,,,,,,Orchard,,

We went for a 2D1N trip with our two kids.
Your staff Arnold was very friendly and gave us very good advice regarding Buds and Splash Zone. I must say Arnold made a big difference and helped allay some fears as we read about overbooking of buds and splash zone.
Buds is the indoor playground, and the staff there were very friendly to my kids (3 and 6), even remembering their name. Kids enjoyed it very much and kept running around
Splash Zone is the outdoor water play zone and it’s fun enough to keep the kids running round and round the slides.
Staff was friendly and helped us change room when the first room did not come with bathtub.
Bathtub was big enough for the kids.
We got stuffed at the Line.
There was a complimentary cake for my birthday, and balloons.

This was my first staycation since hotels started reopening and I’d been worried about references to having an allotted check-in time, luckily we didn’t need to worry and got checked in without issue, and pleasantly surprised to be upgraded and for a beautiful surprise left in the room for my friend.
As others have said, Valley Wing stays include breakfast, all-day drinks, afternoon tea, and evening canapés. I’d not had high expectations of the setting or catering but the Lobby lounge was beautiful, and service was great - really nice to while away an afternoon here, especially sitting outside. Room service was also great, as was the service at Chi spa.
The only slightly sour note wasn’t the fault of the staff, but a rogue guest who left the service staff with a horrific mess to clear up. Other than this one case, generally there seemed to be family friendly vibe, but with other non-family groups enjoying the low-key atmosphere to relax.

Check-in took a little time, but was due to the nature of our back to back packages - but the check-in counter staff were very happy to accommodate. We were two adults with a toddler and a baby, and the combination of the splash zone and budz made it the first choice in family staycation options.
We booked the garden wing with pool view which came with a large balcony to relax on after the kids were asleep. The room itself was large, although the decor probably needs a refresh. Bathroom was large and have separate shower and bath, which was great in giving the kids baths. A cot was already set up in the room when we arrived, which was a very nice touch. The sheets on the cot was however a bit stained (albeit clean). There was also a welcome pack for the kids consisting of bubbles maker a puzzle and some cookies, which was also a thoughtful touch.
The attraction for families are three main things - Budz, Splashzone and the pool area. We had to book 90 minute slots for Budz and Slashzone due to social distancing, but the staff were also very accommodating to admit us even without a booking towards the middle of the 90 minute sessions due to no shows. The toddler loved all three areas and didn't want to leave.
Breakfast was at the Line, and orders were through the phone - not many choices but the food came very fast. The food in general was of a very high standard, but nothing spectacular.
The whole place was set up for families with kids, so it was really great for us, however, not sure if couples looking for a romantic staycation would feel similarly about kids everywhere.

As part of the package we were given dining vouchers which we were told mist be utilised during our stay. But when we tried to reserve, all restaurants were fully booked! In our experience, at least hotels like MBS and RWS bothered calling and sending out email reminders on making early dining reservation. Nothing from shangri la and all restaurants full, how did you expect guest to utilise their vouchers?
2. We had 2 day entry to BUDs for our little one. Prior to check in I had called to ask but staff insisted I needed to check in first. When we arrived, again we were told no slots were available for day 1. Since entry to BUDs was one of the main reason we chose to stay Shangri-la this was very upsetting.
3. Poor service in housekeeping staff. Our TV controller was not working, I contacted housekeeping. The staff came and gave me 2 batteries. I looked at him and the controller. Then he asked me if I wanted him to help with the changing. But isn't this obvious? Because the controllers was tightly sealed in plastic wraps. Did he expect hotel guest to pry open the plastic wrap and change the battery and dispose the old ones ourselves?
4. I pointed out to the same staff that thr toilet bin needed a new plastic liner. He left to take one for me and when he returned he handed me the plastic bag and left. I am shocked. Are hotel guest expected to line the toilet bins ourselves??
The only saving grace in the good service given to us by staff of Waterfall restaurant. They deserve commendation for the good service and friendliness at the restaurant. Besides that the service level in shangri la is shocking.",Date of stay: October 2020,,3,,,,,,,,Orchard,,

In Shangri-la, the service is so unbelievably consistent throughout the property and everyone genuinely wants you to enjoy your stay.
We have chosen the Valley Wing for our 2 night staycation with my daughter and we'll never forget it.
The beautiful lobby, red carpet welcome by amazing Nora, gorgeous room and facilities.
The breakfast, high tea, canapés and drinks throughout the day were all included in the package. It was all served in the Lobby or the Summit room.
The Lobby atmosphere brought me back a few decades, the old class service, elegance, even the uniform resembles how it used to be. And I loved it. It was Edwards' kingdom down there, he makes that place special. Dressed in tux, serving Champagne all day to guests. And so does Flowrence. She was so accommodating throughout our stay and always looked after my daughter's dietary restriction needs.
The food was also very good everywhere. Again, very consistent. Dinners at Shang Palace and Origin Grill were outstanding.
The Chi Spa was a great chapter on its own and memorable.
But again, it's the people, the team that are just genuine, smiling through the masks, hospitable and friendly. I wish I remember more names, but everyone was just fantastic.
Thank you so much.

Super friendly staff and great service!,"After arriving in Changi Airport, I was pleasantly surprised when the 50-seater bus brought me (with 13 other passengers) to Shangri-La Hotel.
Check-in was at a dedicated corner and pretty efficient. Each of us filled in a single-page form and waited for our turn to be checked in. The friendly staff explained the conditions of SHN and services provided (3 meals a day, change of linen once a week, change of towels 3 times a week, etc).
My room was in the tower wing with a great view. The room had a big study table at the window, a huge king size bed, and big bath. The huge TV and many channels provided bulk of entertainment during the 14-night stay. Everything was immaculately clean.
Every meal was well-prepared, tasty and nutritious. Breakfast had cut fruits and whole fruit like oranges, bananas and apples. Lunch and dinner included a sweet pastry to complement the main course. Meals (and other items like linen) were put on a stool placed outside our doors.
My daily routine included two walks. Each session involved 200 laps from one end of the room to the other, and amounted to ~2.2km for each session or 4.4km a day. The hotel also provided suggested video programs (e.g. yoga, exercise, comedy, Ted talks) for us to do each day and on Saturdays, we get to chat with Hossan Leong live on Zoom! There were also recorded greetings from different staff every day!
The only time I could get out of the room was for the nose swab test that is conducted in the hotel. Staff handling the test were friendly and safe distancing measures were strictly adhered to. The swab wasn't uncomfortable to me and felt a little itchy more than anything.
Check-out was scheduled to space out the guests and was quick. We were informed of the check-out time via a letter on the last night.
I was really happy to have the opportunity to stay in Shang for my SHN. They really try their best to make it an amazing experience for us, from the pastry treats to programs to meals.",Date of stay: August 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Orchard,,

It was after I visited the Shangri-La on Sentosa that I decided I would like to try the one on the Orchard road. In the process of my move to Singapore, I stayed in the serviced hotel and that was fun because we could visit the swimming pool at the main hotel. The frog pool was a small outdoor water play-area the first time I visited but now it has evolved into the much bigger Splash Zone which has a pool, water-play pirate ship and more things to play around on. The staff who operate this area are lovely and my little brother made friends with them easily. This new area has brought in a new membership where you can visit splash zone whenever you want! When I did this we got $250 to spend for free and A reservation at the waterfall Italian restaurant. There are free slushies by the pool and they have just bought in a new burger stall that sells cheese and pork fries and 1/3 pound burgers that are insane.

The only downside is the food. Breakfast was the same everyday and the taste was average. I guess I just expected more from Shangrila. We also had In room dining and even that, the food I would say is not worth it. We stayed in Shangrila sentosa before and the food there was better.

- All staff @ Kids Splash Zone (especially Kor Kor Maurice) were truly truly MVPs !
- Breakfast @ Summit Room (Valley Wing) is unmatched here in SG ... the “Bikini sandwich” blew my mind !
- Beware though of the $3 per piece of “mantou” (the small type one) when ordering extra for your chilli crab dish at the Lobby Lounge ... Also, extra “youtiao” (macham only 1/3 the height of the standard size) comes in at a bewildering price of $3 too ...
- Overzealous lifeguards at the main pool, who need to be more discerning about the line that separates kids just having harmless fun & what constitutes a genuine safety risk (whatever it is, do NOT peep your blaring whistles just because a toddler touches a railing or a teen rests on the lane dividers for a split second !)

Chandeliers and fresh flowers are everywhere in the valley wing. I can’t imagine how much effort goes into maintaining such perfection. Although everything is classic design, all is spick and span with full attention to details.
The room has a nice living area, dedicated vanity table which I love ❤️and a huge marble bathroom.
A generous fruit platter, Nespresso machines, soft drinks and fruit juices and tea - with a Wedgewood tea set is included. And also a care pack with masks, sanitizers and hand lotion for going out. A birthday cake and decor was also prepared by the hotel. Lovely! Appreciate.
The bathroom have double sinks, separate shower and wc/bidet. Toiletries are lovely Loccitane which I think you can’t you wrong.
Love the changing area outside the toilet! It has a shoe box, coat hanger, sitting area and full wardrobe.
Bed and linen excellent. Super smooth and comfortable. Everyone is prob able to get a good night sleep. Macaroons where provided for turn down and also a book mark with a paragraph from Lost Horizon which is a nice touch.
High tea and evening canapés are provided and so are all day alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks at the champagne bar and lounge.
Breakfast served at the gorgeous Summit Room was excellent. The food was just amazing and the room had a wide view of the lush greenery outside. Had a good Chinese dinner at Shang Palace too.
Had a lovely swim in the pool and also a walk around the gardens. There are so many type of beautiful plants that are so well taken care of! Also tried Chi Spa - a massage was included in the package. Very good therapist- and you leave feeling renewed.

Firstly if you drive, you may choose to park at the Valley Wing side, and it's like a private carpark that you'll appreciate the proximity to the Valley Wing lobby.
Perhaps it was because we stayed during the National Day long weekend, there was a crowd at the Lobby Lounge when we went down for afternoon tea and cocktail/canape. Afternoon tea was a nice selection of pastries, sandwiches and scones, paired with a palatable champagne - Veuve Clicquot. We really loved the scones (with real good clotted cream and jam), and glad that the team could provide a 2nd serving of the scones.
Cocktail/canape was a little disappointing. There were only 5 canapes for each person, and a limited selection of wine and whisky. Nonetheless, there was an impressive selection of gins from around the world.
On facilities and spa, it was great that the pool and gym was opened with everyone practicing social distancing, and wearing masks if they're not swimming. The masseuses at Chi Spa were really professional and polite. We really enjoyed the 1.5hr massage that was included in the package.
Valley Wing guests could choose to have breakfast at either The Line or Summit Room, which is quite commendable as many hotels choose to close their club lounge in . The breakfast at Summit Room was very impressive with a wide selection of a la carte mains and other breakfast items.
Last but not least. We were given early check-in and late check-out, however we heard that this is no longer included in the package. This is a pity because this would entice people to return for another staycation, especially if the price is right.",Date of stay: August 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Orchard,,

USB port for charging electronic devices was nowhere to be seen and this certainly got the impression marks deducted.
I like the big free-form swimming pool. 2 if not 3 lifeguards could be seen on duty every time we went for a relaxing swim. Unlike some other hotels which may implement booking of time slots to use the pool facility, Shangri-La Hotel allows maximum of 50 guests to be around the pool area. During certain popular timings, the pool could get crowded and exceeded the allowed capacity, the staffs would have to ask the guests to come back later. We experienced that on our very first afternoon. Nevertheless, good job to those pool staffs for enforcing the safe distancing measures.
The canapés served during evening cocktails comprised of a set of 5 small snack items. We were a little disappointed that our request for asking a refill of certain food items was denied. We were told that the chef had only prepared limited number of sets, so if we only wanted certain food item, then the other sets would have that item short for. However, they would be glad to serve us a second helping of the set. Not wanting to waste food, we didn’t have second helping as clearly not all the 5 items were to our liking.
Breakfast was served at Summit Room. With the new normal, self-service buffet line was not allowed. The breakfast menu however was extensive and sumptuous enough. Now here was the biggest challenge that we had experienced throughout our stay, that was to catch the staffs’ attention. Be it during afternoon tea or evening cocktails at the Champagne Bar or breakfast at Summit Room, the staffs were either not seen at all in our vicinity or they were always hurriedly off to elsewhere, passing by our tables. A few times I thought I had caught their attention but apparently not. Asking for drinks refill was difficult, hoping that the staffs would take initiative to clear used plates without us signalling them to was challenging too. Now with reduced capacity and safe distancing measures put in place, there weren’t many tables in Champagne Bar or Summit Room to begin with. Somehow, our presence could still be easily ignored.
The rose petals bubble bath on the first night was indeed an indulgence, I enjoyed it very much. However, on the next day when we returned from our lunch, we were surprised to see the rose petals were not cleared from the bathtub during the tidying up of the room. Later of the evening before we left for our massage experience, my partner called the Housekeeping for a turndown service, and had also explicitly instructed that the rose petals to be cleared away. After a wonderful and rejuvenating massage at Chi, The Spa, we returned to our room, shocked to see those familiar wrinkled rose petals still lying gloomily in the bathtub. Gave another call to the Housekeeping and they sent a staff over almost instantly, finally the petals were cleared.
After months long of circuit breaker and hotel’s closure to room reservation for leisure purpose, I feel that the staffs seem not ready to serve, at least not wholeheartedly. As a Valley Wing guest, I didn’t feel that quality service that as a big brand hotel should provide, hence a star off my rating.",Date of stay: August 2020,,4,,,,,,,,Orchard,,

Not sure whether it's because we are locals staying in a local hotel or now it's during COVID-19 period and services have to be somewhat compromised, the level of service falls short of my expectation in few areas.
Guests recognition is lacking as compared to my stay at Horizon Club Floor at many other Shangri-la properties. It makes my even more appreciative of many overseas staff who were able to remember the guests' names.
We had breakfast at The Summit Room which is exclusive and happy with the ala carte menu. The only let down was that nobody cares to ask us whether we need to have a refill of coffee or fruit juices considering that there were just few tables of guests.
The snack offering during Happy Hour is very limited and we are also not allowed to have selective choices of canapes. It may be easier for the kitchen and service staff, it will create food wastage for leaving some of them untouched. On the positive note, we like the Veuve Clicquot champagne being served throughout the day.
We enjoyed dipping at the spacious free form pool and the staff and life guards there are warm and welcoming too. The massage treatment at the Chi Spa was great too.
Overall, it was an enjoyable stay.",Date of stay: July 2020,,4,,,,,,,,Orchard,,

On arrival we were very pleasantly surprised with the open, inviting decor and atmosphere. The check in procedure was prompt, pleasant and professional. The space is beautiful, especially for a city centre property, although our autistic son did struggle with the way sound travelled around the space (This is unavoidable because of its design but we were able to avoid further distress as after the initial check in we used the Club lounge service centre).
Having booked a club level room for a family of 3 I would absolutely recommend that families alternatively opt for a family level room. This was by far the best family level we’ve come across; the laundry room was a pleasant and welcome surprise.
Star team member award has to go to Shawn Tan, the duty manager, who went over and above to help make our stay a memorable one. He even made sure he was available to wave goodbye when we left for the airport!
That said all the staff were courteous and professional with the club lounge team making us feel exceptionally welcome. The club lounge here has particularly impressive views, food and drinks service.

From the moment we arrived and were given such a fantastic welcome and stunning room by the lovely Seri our stay here was absolutely excellent. In fact, throughout our stay the whole team at reception could not have been more helpful and were outstanding throughout.
We were given a corner room on the eighth floor of the garden wing and could not recommend it higher – definitely one of the best rooms we have had anywhere. The chocolates and cake brought to us were a lovely surprise and very much appreciated.
The ambience throughout the hotel exudes quality, tranquility and relaxation.
We ate twice at the Italian Waterfall restaurant in the hotel and both meals were good and many thanks to Paul who looked after us well.

The concierge team is very helpful too and always so cheerful and engaging. The room service is great, especially Ms Farah who always takes my order and she is super efficient and friendly.
The customer experience is so perfect even till the end when Mr Aries sent me off to my car. This is really exceptional and I am so thankful that I had chosen to stay in your hotel. Thank God.
The Guest service team is always so willing to help and ensure that my needs are taken care of. My thanks to Ms Qurai Shia and Jack as well.
The Garden Wing room is fabulous with a balcony (for fresh air) and beautiful flowers..,so therapeutic and comforting when one has to stay in the room for almost 15 days. It is quiet, private and yet does not create a feeling of isolation. The room is also cozy and spacious. Thank you for the upgrade.. I really appreciate it.

For many years, it was the hotel of choice for professionals, especially when staying in the Horizon Club. For the extra cost, one got excellent well-appointed rooms, and a degree of exclusive service in the breakfast and Club areas
On our recent trip, we found that the room had been redesigned, probably by someone who had never stayed there. The bathroom is smaller, with the shower in a so-called wet-room area with a slippery floor, which could be dangerous. A former feature used to be the full size bath-tub in which one could relax, but this has been replaced by a small steep-sided one which is difficult to get out of. For some reason, a small induction hob has been added to the entrance area. The kind of people who used to frequent the Shangri-la are happy to pay to eat in restaurants, and don't want the smell of cooking in their bedrooms. We requested twin beds, but were given one enormous) double bed.
Breakfast is now only served in the Line restaurant next to the pool. This is self-service, sitting at plastic tables. There is nothing wrong with the food, and the choice is enormous, but the atmosphere is similar to the concourse at Victoria Station in London, but with a few extra screaming kids. Gone are the white linen tablecloths, and the smiling service. Similarly, the Club lounge no longer has friendly waiters carrying bottles of wine to top up your glass. The wine comes out of a self service dispensing machine. The staff are efficient but impersonal, and many of them have poor language skills - clearly not Singaporean.
The atmosphere remains outstanding at the Italian ""Waterfall"" restaurant, with well prepared food , well served and accompanied by a wide choice of wines.",Date of stay: March 2020,,4,,,,,,,,Orchard,,

It's just not huge but very well chosen articles and the quality was excellent. Only complaint about the breakfast is the coffee service. You can make much better coffee by yourself using Nespresso machines which are available there.
Room and bathroom very nicely renovated. Only complain in that sector comes from the age of the hotel. Almost 50 years ago room height was lower and there is not enough natural light in the room. One thing I suggest is please remove those large writing desks which are totally blocking the windows and takes the last spacious feeling away.
The incoming experience was one the best. Whole lobby level staff is so awesome. Every time we were around there someone noticed us and came to talk. There was no difference who was it. Everyone in there behaved the same. Final conclusion was the late checkout until 5pm combined with afternoon tea service. It was really nice to stay at hotel premises when our flight left just before midnight. Also the lobby atmosphere and design makes blissful feeling.
Then the garden or how to describe that paradise around the pool. Funny feeling to be few hundred meters from Orchard street and totally inside a forest. Shuttle was a nice addition though it might go more often and directly to Orchard MRT.
When we wandered around the hotel we thought that this would be a nice place for a family vacation if you have kids. Like a resort but in the middle of the city.",Date of stay: February 2020,,4,,,,,,,,Orchard,,

We were blown away by the lobby and the beauty of it. After a temperature check (in light of Coronavirus) we were given a complimentary chilled smoothie and a free upgrade to a garden room for our honeymoon! What an incredible room it was with flowers, a card, a towel swan on the bed and a chocolate cake sent to the room for us!
The bathroom had the usual complementaries and we enjoyed the shower. My husband said that the gym was fab and the pool was huge and relaxing. We went for a wander around the hotel and it is stunning especially the waterfall and coy carp/turtles!! We loved The Line restaurant for the lunch buffet and to be honest, cannot fault this hotel.

We were even given orchids as we were shown to the elevator!
There is a beautiful little garden area with a small waterfall and pond with koi fish. Everything was absolutely five stars all the way. I'm so glad my sister's friend recommended it to us!
We did not do the breakfast as there are so many wonderful places to eat for very little money in Singapore.

Au wrote a review Feb 2020,2 contributions,Disappointing experience,"We spent 5 nights at this hotel with our 2 grandchildren, twins aged 3, together with their parents and maids, checking into 3 rooms of their Horizon Club.
The hotel was somewhat dated, however we did check in their Tower Wing, which was recently renovated. Even then, the rooms were not luxurious as I would expect from the Shangri La hotel chain and for some inexplicable reasons, the placement of the king bed was at a 45 degree angle, which made the room very odd indeed.
The hotel was not child friendly at all - the playroom was on a paid to use basis, something like Singapore $70 for a 3 hour use and only admit one accompanying adult. The Horizon Club (more about that later) was not opened to children between 5-8pm and when they were allowed to enter, they were confined to a small room at the back of the club. None of the food items offered at the club lounge were suitable for young children.
As for the Horizon Club itself, it was a total disappointment - during the whole day, there were very few choices of food items offered and no wines, except for the 5-8pm session. The choice of reading materials was limited to 3 /4 newspaper, mainly local newspapers. There were no games like chess, back gammon, etc. available.
The decor of the Horizon Club was quite spartan, as were the offerings of food and beverages.
Generally, the attitude of staff members at the club was guarded, if not outright hostile, I'd suppose they must have had some terrible experience with hotel guests, or they were overworked during the peak season of the Chinese New Year holiday.
All in all, a rather disappointing experience in such a nice city as Singapore, with such a wide variety of choices of fine hotels.",Date of stay: February 2020,,2,,,,,,,,Orchard,,

Check-in was a breeze, and the room was probably one of the finest available in the 5-star category in the whole of Singapore. No disappointment there.
When we wanted to get a quick bite on the night of our arrival, the Shophouse patisserie proved to be our first surprise. Not only was the shop assistant unfamiliar with the range of their pastries and cakes available, she was also ill at ease at answering our questions on them. Granted the products on show seemed attractive enough but without proper introduction/recommendations, we had to settle for a couple of donuts (which were delicious).
As a member of the Golden Circle loyal programme, I was actually dumbfounded when it came to using my points in exchange for breakfast. I had to download the e-voucher on my phone, had it printed out at the reception, verified and signed there, and then bring it to The Line where the staff had to double-check it against the names of hotel guests on their list. The whole process was practically executed by humans (guests and staff) with no help from any software or computer. Having said that, the buffet breakfast was Shangri-la standard, first class in range, presentation and taste!
Another surprise (and disappointment) came when we had to have an early dinner at the Lobby Lounge. Because of the layout of the tables and inadequate number of serving staff, the service was haphazard and inattentive. Food-wise, one could have gotten a much better Chicken Rice at any food court along Orchard Road.
While this hotel has a complimentary shuttle bus to the main shopping areas, the limited capacity of the bus means that it can fill up very fast as it also goes through the other buildings in the development. With the frequency of once every hour and a travelling time of just a few minutes, surely the hotel could well afford to increase the frequency of the service to a more accommodating level.
Would I come back again? A definte yes but not for the service and food at the Lobby Lounge.",Date of stay: December 2019,,4,,,,,,,,Orchard,,

I loved the horizontal safe - so much easier to access and a vanity unit with mirror and hair dryer - designed for female guests!
The pool is large and plenty of sun loungers and attendants were quick to assist. I had a fabulous foot massage poolside - thank you Noor. I also enjoyed a facial treatment in the wonderful Chi Spa. Jeseline was superb and my skin was glowing afterwards. Breakfast was out of this rifle - even for a Shangri-La- the char kway teow was delicious and the chicken broth so good.

Three of us stayed here November 2019 in the Horizon Club Junior Suite, which gave us access to the Horizon Club, and included breakfast. I highly recommend the upgrade to Horizon Club, it's pretty handy, and makes check in and check out extra quick and easy.
The hotel itself is fantastic, with very well maintained grounds, big pool to relax at (treat yourself to the poolside massage), and perfect location; within walking distance to ION Orchard, and the MRT. The room was immaculate; spacious, with an enormous closet, little kitchenette, sitting area and a big washroom with all the amenities you could possibly need during your stay.
My favorite part of the hotel I must say was the gym, of course! So far it's probably the biggest gym I have seen at a hotel and I really enjoyed it!
Breakfast was simply delicious, both downstairs or in the Horizon club. Though in the restaurant breakfast options are endless, you really don't know where to start.
Hotel staff are very nice and helpful; they even helped me to have my headphones charged through the night.
Though not situated directly in the city, the MRT is next door and makes getting around a breeze. PLUS the hop on hop off bus stops near by as well, so there are many cheap options to get around and see the city if it's your first time visiting.

We stayed at the Junior suite with access to Horizon Club lounge which was a nice escape from the crowd that started filling the hotel over the Chinese New Year holiday.
Due to corona virus outbreak we decided to extend our stay and duly booked our 2nd week of stay 4 days in advance. I also checked with the counter staff to confirm that booking through the app would give us a better price. We did a price check on the app later to find out that if we had made the booking just 1 day earlier, we could have saved $550 off the reservation. So no savings for booking in advance.
I pointed this out to reservation. A lady got back to state that they are willing to use the difference as credit to my other expenses in the hotel but would not refund the difference.
The trouble with that is that as a Golden Circle member I actually get a 15% discount off my bill if I paid in cash. Which I did for all my earlier meals.
With this new credit I reluctantly signed off some of my bills to my room to forfeit the 15% just to try to use up the credit.
Unfortunately by the time I checked out, I was not able to completely use up the credit. When I wrote to the sales lady requesting if I could have the differences back while stating how much we enjoyed the stay and how we plan to come back again over summer, I just received a curt email response “the balance amount are non-refundable”. No acknowledgement of our loyalty and not on our choice of extended stay at the hotel.
Of course this leaves us with a bad aftertaste. After all, the pricing did disadvantaged those who booked early and while we did not charge all our expenses to the room tab, we did spend for family dinner at the hotel on at least 3 separate occasions paying in cash to take advantage of the GC member discount.

The Shangri-la is a beautiful hotel with exceptional staff who go out of their way to make you feel welcome. The Valley wing perks were incredible. We enjoyed afternoon tea, delicious canapés every evening and a variety of drinks throughout the day. The gin trolley was our favourite. Our room was spacious and had a lovely view out to the gardens and the pool. They decorated it for me for my birthday and had a little cake for me.
Breakfast was also amazing and there is a large variety to choose from, all freshly prepared for you.
Please explore the grounds as there is a large variety of Orchids growing around the gardens.

I’d spoken so much about it that we decided to make it one of the locations for our honeymoon. And it totally lived up to expectations. The staff are beyond polite and helpful, the service is absolutely top class, and the food and drink offering is excellent. Perhaps I preferred the old bar that used to be at the top of the Tower Wing, but the new Origins bar off the lobby was a very pleasant place for a drink, and had a great range of drinks.
Any negatives? One, but it’s so minor - mid morning, they put a lane line across the pool to separate the deep end from the rest, which makes it a bit harder to swim lengths. But in every other regard, we had a flawless stay. I can’t wait to find an excuse to go back.",Date of stay: January 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Orchard,,

The Knolls is less formal than I remember it - which is good and the food was excellent for both dinner and breakfast. We also had dinner at Cassia - make sure you have the Wagyu.
The hotel has a number of 'experiences' - we did the dim sum class, which I recommend. Its a really fun 1 hour 15 minutes with a chef from HK and you make your own dim sum - its wayyyy more complicated than I realised.

Capella has a reputation of being the best in every measurable way including service, food quality, exclusiveness, room furnishings and fittings.
The first impressive beckoning was when I received a phone call from Sophia prior to my arrival. She asked if I was celebrating anything special and availed herself to me throughout the stay. Humbled by the gesture and also unfamiliar with such impeccable service, I said “I’m just doing a staycation”. Later on in our conversation I mentioned I just got engaged 2 weeks back and she happily cheered “that’s a reason for celebration!”
On arrival, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that I was accorded an upgrade because of my GHA status by Suveen Thanggapan. Perhaps word got to him that I was celebrating my engagement and thus he went the extra mile to ensure a memorable experience.
You know it’s a good sign when I’ve barely checked in and already I want to make another booking at Capella.",Date of stay: November 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Tiong Bahru,,

Red flags for me are:
- hotel did not meet my specific request for a quiet room and gave us first a villa in the middle of renovation work
- lobby security is too rigid and makes you feel you are not welcome, crowd control should be better handled and nobody should have to wait outside the lobby,
- housekeeping should check mini bar is full before giving any room, as for both room we received it was empty
- sunbeds should be kept dry and should be dry when a guest receive a room,
- fumigation of the pool area should not be done at 4pm when guest first discover the hotel as it just makes the whole pool very noisy,
- baggy guy says he will come back at a certain time then never comes back,
All these details makes you feel like this is not a professional luxury hotel, like there is a lack of control. I believed I received way better service in 5 stars hotels in Paris, Beijing or Vietnam, often for a cheaper price.
The overall stay was enjoyable, but be advised that if you stay there, you might have to deal with all these little annoyances and have to ask for services that you know should have been done.
Having said that I still believe Capella is probably one of the best hotel in Singapore, and I think with more attention to details they can raise to become a top player. They were accommodating and reacted to my complains in the appropriate expected way.
Location of the hotel is excellent, The Knolls restaurant is very good, everything is very clean. Music volume in common area is at the right setting. Pool staff is helpful and gives you complementary cocktails. Complementary Tea time in the Living room is good.

At the price that we paid, I'd expect everything to be top notch: the service, the hospitality, the food, the cleanliness.
A lot of these things fell short of our expectations for the price, and it started at check-in. I understand that there are COVID-19 regulations that have necessitated a change in hotel operations, but that shouldn't come at the expense of the guest experience. When we arrived, we were left outside the hotel for several minutes with our bags waiting for someone to come help us. It's not a huge deal, but it didn't feel like we were made welcome, even if we did have to respect social distancing during the check-in process.
The in-room dining and the food at The Knolls for breakfast sometimes felt stale, and many dishes lacked flavour. We often needed to call the front desk multiple times for in-room dining, housekeeping or anything else - not a big deal, but not what I'd expect for a hotel of this stature and price. Our room also didn't feel clean.
Generally the hotel staff were lovely and polite to us, but it's tough to overlook so many service errors.
What's also telling is that I left a detailed response to a survey they sent out shortly after my stay - indicating a lot of these shortcomings - and no one's been in touch to find out more. We wouldn't come back.",Date of stay: October 2020,,2,,,,,,,,Tiong Bahru,,

The people made it great!,"We stayed for 2 nights in Capella for a birthday celebration, and a surprise proposal on the 2nd night.
The people at Capella made the stay very memorable for us. The star of the show was Wilbur, who arranged all our resort activities for us, gave us a tour of the grounds, checked in on us throughout to make sure everything was fine, arranged a few surprises for us when he heard we were celebrating a birthday, and took care of us throughout. Capella is lucky to have someone like Wilbur!
Next, Darren from Bob's Bar made the rum appreciation class very memorable. He spent a lot of time talking to us about different types of rum and their flavour profiles, told us about his personal favourites, shared interesting experiences he's had, and gave us some tips on choosing a drink in the future. We saw him again when we came back at night for a drink, and asked him for recommendations. He then matched the flavours we liked to the cocktails available, and true enough, they were really good.
Finally, Viknesh from The Knolls also made our stay. We went for dinner there on our 2nd night, and he found out about our surprise marriage proposal (through Wilbur) before we even arrived at the restaurant. When we came in, he was very friendly and polite, immediately congratulated us and brought us to our table, and took great care of us the entire night, also checking in on us a few times throughout the night. We'll be back at The Knolls just for Viknesh!
There were several other people whose names I didn't get who made the stay great as well, from the people at the door who coordinated our arrival with Wilbur when we left the hotel for lunch, to the friendly Indian gentleman at the Living Room who gave us a nice table and brought us some snacks when he found out our check-in was delayed.
Finally, another shout-out for Wilbur: he knew about my proposal plan and coordinated my decorator's arrival and room setup, stayed with them to ensure the setup was done well, did some additional decorations as well such as printing photos and arranging some flower petals on the bed, called me when everything was ready, then came in after the proposal to help us take pictures. The room setup was really good, and it was all thanks to Wilbur's romantic side! And ladies, he said he's single, so grab him while you can! ;)
Overall an amazing stay, and I'll be back, especially because of the people. Highly recommend!",Date of stay: November 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Tiong Bahru,,

Instead of detailing the hardware, i’d document my typical day at Capella. But first, let me say that breakfast at the Knolls was good. Damage was $48++. The ala-carte buffet concept was a good idea as the quality was preserved. The scrambled eggs and avocado toast were awesome and the best i’ve had in a hotel. However, the spread is not great so i only did brekkie once. Also, my experience reserving my room through the phone was excellent.

Requested for children amenities before stay but was not prepared. Nonetheless matters were rectified quickly, however there’s no children toiletries except for toothbrush. But the the toothpaste is for adults, not suitable for a 3 year old. Luckily I brought my own. There’s turn down service on the first night. Refill of water and given 1 eye masks. As read in previous reviews, it will be nice if Capella could take into consideration how many guest were staying and provide the number. Masks were given but none for kids. Would be nice if they could also provide plastic cups in rooms which were used in restaurants. Complimentary minibar with bottled water and soft drinks. Turn down service not available at second night. Only offered bottles of water. Pools were great, floats available at children pool. No pre booking required. Breakfast was nice with ala carte. Cost of breakfast for child was $25++. 4 years old below was free. Knolls service not attentive enough for dinner and breakfast. Had to remind them of forgotten orders and to repeat my requests for children’s cutlery. Location of hotel is nice, however staff is lacking information Sentosa transportation. We wanted to go car free and asked directions to get to Beach station. We were told either to walk to Impiah monorail station or wait for hotel shuttle to RWS. We decided to walk as we wanted to head to Beach station and not RWS. We then realise there’s Sentosa buses along the main road where we could catch a bus to Beach Station for free. The other quicker way is to walk the pathway down from the children pool (Stairs involved) to Palawan beach and it’s just 2 stops to Beach station on the Beach tram. We wasn’t told of the pathway to Palawan beach as well. Such information should be shared even though we aren’t tourists. Capella is a pet friendly hotel and we saw guests bringing dogs and cats. We were also given complimentary parking coupons but limited to 4 pieces which is more than sufficient.

Once is enough.,"My children sent me here for my BD. Thanks Kids! We were in a one-room villa. A real retreat. The lounge pool, the bath, rain showers, living room , bed room... all well maintained. So tranquil and serene. Beautiful and clean. Lived up to the price you pay for. But I think my home bed is more comfy.
We were well served except 1) was not given any brief upon check-in. Were not aware of on- the- house afternoon tea ( I just read some review written a month ago about this same experience before writing my review. Apparently, they didn't make an effort to do something about it. Intentionally? To avoid crowd? I don't know. )
2) No information given about activities in the hotel. I had to call and enquire. So managed to catch a short historical tour.
3) No quick orientation given about the villa. Was by trial and error , hide and seek we figured out where is what and what is where - control switches behind walls, in the drawers , knobs hidden.... sigh.
The pools were somewhat sad and tired. Thought I was going into ponds. Algae covered sides, extremely rough granite pool floors, dirty water. But the attentive staff put a smile on our faces with their service. Fresh towels and drinks :) Thanks guys!!
One funny incident...on our second night a staff knocked on our door. We let him in not knowing what he wanted. He took out the tea and coffee tray from the drawer. Left it on the top of the cupboard and went to make our bed. That was way past 8pm. We politely told him no need to do the bed and he left in a hurry leaving the tray still sitting outside. hmmm...
Capella has made a name for itself- its grand ancient colonial facade , lush greenery, tranquil premises tread upon by some rich and famous. That's it. Don't think it's a good place for family staycation. Can be pretty unexciting and boring staying with the grand old dame here. Sorry. Too solemn and serious a place for a fun staycation. More like a quiet place for honeymooners and stately affairs. A nice place to chill out away from the madding crowd... that is ... if you don't mind losing an arm and a leg.",Date of stay: October 2020,,4,,,,,,,,Tiong Bahru,,

Capella Singapore,Lucy Z,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/lucyzheng22,"Crans-Montana, Switzerland",Lucy Z wrote a review Oct 2020,17 contributions,The closest it gets to Bali this year,"My boyfriend booked 2 nights at the capella resort for my birthday. The hotel is gorgeous, especially the pools and the quiet setting immersed in greenery. There's plenty of activities for in-house guests to do. So we did not step out for a single minute.
We stayed at a regular room the first night and then moved to a garden villa. Both rooms were really spacious. I especially enjoyed the view on the regular room on the top floor and the privacy in the villa with outdoor shower, plunge pool and bathtub was amazing.
However, we were quite disappointed by the service, especially given the reputation of this property. But first I also do want to give credit to the pool staff and f&b (we tried all the restaurants including the in room dining) really attentive and warm. The disappointment was more about the reception and reservation team. They often forget things or even not arrange what my boyfriend has previously communicated with them prior our check in. Several chaser calls has to be made before our request would be fulfilled. My bouquet of flowers was lost and had to wait upon leaving the property to trace it back. When during check out this was highlighted. Our grab almost cancelled on us if we didn't added surcharge.
Also during check out the receptionist didn't care much how we enjoyed our stay at all.
For the price they charge I really think service can be greatly improved. Especially thinking they had all the lockdown time to improve staff trainings.
Food wise I really enjoyed the pool menu as well as the dinner at Knolls, the cod and boef bourguignon were delicious, selection of wines also really curated. The disappointment was on the breakfast, very limited choices and not so fresh. My dim sum were super dry and tasted as the ones from the supermarket. Noodles were also quite average. At least I liked the fact that it was a la carte in small portions so there was not so much waste involved. If you spend your special occasion there they also don't really care much there was a sad 3 balloons in my room no welcome card and a really tasteless cheesecake as birthday wish. Again it's fine if you charge 300/400 SGD per night but when you charge 800/1300 SGD my expectations also will be equally expensive.
All in all capella is definitely a great staycation experience if you look for a total privacy and quietness but definitely the service is not there yet.",Date of stay: October 2020,,3,,,,,,,,Tiong Bahru,,

We've been spoilt with amazing opportunities to travel, and it was my husband's 40th birthday so everything had to be perfect.
The entire team at Capella Singapore did an amazing job! It was perfect from a smooth check-in, to the safe distancing measures as well as fun activities to keep us occupied over a 3-night stay.
Constellation Room
If you're lucky enough to snag one of the 4 exclusive constellation rooms - book it now! You won't regret it. We thoroughly enjoyed the spacious room with a gorgeous hot tub with a view. We booked the one without a seaview, but it worked out perfectly as we could bird watch from the comfort of our tub. I love the aesop amenities as well as the little kit they provide with a couple of masks, wet wipes and hand sanitizers. Super comfortable and perfect for a romantic couples stay.
The Pools
One of the most ""IG-worthy"" locations in Capella - we're spoilt for choice with 3 different levels and types of pools. The BEST part is - there's an Adults Only pool as well as a lap pool that's pretty private. The only other hotel which has an adults only pool (section) is at the Marina Bay Sands. The pool staff were super on the ball - getting us set up with towels and cold water as soon as we arrive.
Auriga Spa
We've had the best massage in Singapore here. Remember to bring your swimwear to enjoy the facilities. My hubby and I especially enjoyed the hot plunge pool and the sauna room. Picked the PS I Love You couple's treatment - starting off with a foot bath, followed by a 90 minute massage, a 30 minute facial massage as well as a 30 minute flower bath. This ended with a lovely cocktail at Bob's Bar with a couple of yummy snacks.
The Knolls
We had lunch here once, on top of ordering some drinks by the pool and LOTS of room service. The menu is quite small but everything we tried on it tastes delicious. I'm especially addicted to their nasi goreng (ask for extra chilli padi on the side if you can handle it).
Bob's Bar
We had a delightful experience close to sunset with drinks after the spa, as well as a rum appreciation masterclass (which you have to book in advance with your Culturist). Really fun session with a knowledgable team - I wish we had more time to hangout and order their other cocktails.
Cassia
A hidden gem, Cassia is Capella's very popular contemporary Chinese restaurant. I managed to book us a table for lunch on our last day (as they were too full for dinner when we were staying there). The decor is absolutely beautiful, very friendly and helpful staff (who were meticulous when they found out I couldn't have pork/lard - they even gave me a different chilli sauce). My husband had the set lunch, and I indulged in some tasty dim sum, wagyu beef and foie gras with caviar. The prawn noodle with superior broth is a must-try as well! I was honestly too full for dessert, but they gave this amazing flower jelly and mango pudding which was too yummy to go to waste.
The Capella Culturist team was also really kind - helping me to arrange for birthday balloons and champagne I pre-ordered. Everything was set up beautifully as we got back from Auriga - perfection!
Honestly one of the best hotels we've stayed in - we'll be back!",Date of stay: October 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Tiong Bahru,,

Capella Singapore,Angie X,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/anxzac,"Singapore, Singapore",Angie X wrote a review Oct 2020,43 contributions,3rd's time not a charm.,"This is our 3rd time here but we felt that the hospitality has went down instead of up. We stayed 3d2n...
What has been done well in this visit:
1. The first time we were there.. Sea view really depicts full sea view.. The 2nd time we went right after our wedding, we had a room forest view despite paying for the same sea view room..
At least this time round we managed to snagged a hybrid of seaview + forest view. So for those booking sea view, just indicate unblock sea view if you would not want to stand up just to see the sea beyond the trees..
2. As it was our birthday and wedding anniversary, we invited our family (we booked an additional room with less than 5 pax in total of 2 rooms including the furkid.) They prepared amenities for the furkid: Food bowl, water and a bed. That was a nice touch even though shortfall (i.e toys and custom made bed) of what the influencers shown on IG, but of course we don't expect the same treatment.. We understand they were there for marketing purposes.
3. We booked a babymoon masaage. THIS WAS THE BEST THING in this staycation. Kudos to the Auriga Spa staff. They made us felt so welcome the moment we were there.. The massage was fantastic. The bed was adjustable for pregnant mums like me and it was e most comfortable massage bed.. The massage and facial was also really fantastic..
4. They have some activities in the hotel.. We took the canvas painting.. It was a nice bonding touch if you have nothing to do.
5. The food is impeccable. The roti prata for breakfast menu execeeded all my expectations (must try). During this period, you may also want to ask for what is not on the menu because they it is no longer selfservice buffet so they may have omitted some items out like smoked salmon and bacon.
6. The staff at the swimming pool made us felt really welcome.
What went wrong?
1. When we arrived, we had to have our credit card amount held which is normal for all hotels.. They have to hold for incidental charges and the room charges. What wasnt told was that they held our spa charges after we went for the spa WITHOUT informing us at all or with our acknowledgement. I didnt know hotels can use our card details to swipe for charges without informing. We only found it out after we checked out and received transaction notice. While checking out, we found weird in the full amount and requested for itemised bill to look through (no idea why they didnt provide us that to begin with) They charged us 2 additional afternoon tea set which was included in the babymoon package, so please ask for the itemised bill and check them properly. Also, instead of using the withheld amount, they did another transaction of the total cost. So we had to wait a week or so for the withheld amount to be released.
2. While other pregnant mummies stay, the hotel provided the snuggler pillow (preg pillow) without them having to ask for it. We asked for it the first night and the reception/housekeeping told us they don't have it. So while flipping their hotel book on the 2nd day, we realised they do have it and requested again. This time round they sent it over.
3. The hotel is obviously low on manpower but they focus all on their marketing activities. For e.g. During our first visit, they gave us a bottle of red wine for our birthday. On our 2nd visit as it was right after our wedding, we had cake from them. It was all very nice touch. In this visit, we had nothing, not even a greeting, which was also fine. But imagine the feeling of seeing Capella's IG that they repost stories of guests(/influencers) with special perks of cakes cards and all e whatnot.. It just doesn't seem that nice.
4. They have different TVs for different rooms. My room's TV couldnt do screen mirroring and is obviously very dated while my cousin's room had screen mirroring which was really useful to cast shows during the evenings when we had nothing else to do. So do ask for a room with screen mirroring Tv.
5. Book activities in advance especially popular ones like cocktail making. It was fully booked even though we tried to book 2 weeks in advance.
So I would suggest to only visit when they are ready to embrace the commoners who paid to stay instead of the influencers who may have paid or may not have paid to stay. This place holds special memories to me and the view is great. We will want to visit again but only when theh finish the marketing wave first and get back to the Capella standards.",Date of stay: September 2020,,3,,,,,,,,Tiong Bahru,,

The environment is quiet with lots of greenery and the room at level 5 offers a good view. The hotel is a dog friendly hotel and we brought our pet poodle as well for the stay and was provided with small pet bed and bowl. The sound system installed in the room works well (if you managed to connect it to your device in the room), except that other people may accidentally connect to our sound system via the bluetooth pairing. we have more water, thinner pillows were fullfiled promptly. Food was good at the Knolls, however was disappointed that the Cassia was not open for Sunday dinner.
There are some area of improvements though for the following :
- was told that our booking via hotel.com covered the breakfast buffet during our check in. However, was told other wise during our last day that we have to pay for the breakfast which we probably would have made other arrangement if we were told earlier about it. Maybe its better to inform earlier and be clear.
- During the check in, we have informed our choice of daily newspaper upon request from the staff. However, didn't received any newspaper until the last day of.
- We informed over phone call that we were going out with our pet hence, requested for make up room service to be performed while we were out with our pet. however, it was not done when we were back about 1 hour later and we decided not to have any room makeup service then as it would be inconvienient as my pet would be around.
- and yes, I think its good to manage your expectation for bday celebration. There were only 3 balloons placed in the room. And no other special arrangements included despite that my husband has informed earlier prior to our stay for a cake for the celebration.
Overall, its a place to go if you crave for a quiet resort environment with greenery (5/5 points for that), however, good if they can look into resolving some of the above to create a better experience for the guests. I would probably give a (3/5 points) for the overall service.",Date of stay: October 2020,,3,,,,,,,,Tiong Bahru,,

Capella Singapore,mahagonydove,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/mahagonydove,"Singapore, Singapore",mahagonydove wrote a review Sep 2020,12 contributions,Manage your expectations. Not recommended for birthday celebration.,"Booked the Sentosa Staycation package and I wonder if services and experiences are accordingly reduced because of the discounted price which at S$700+ a night is still significant.
The average rating given is because not all expectations were met. The main saving grace was that the most of staff were good especially staff in The Knolls and at the Pool who really made sure all requests were fulfilled. Other saving grace is the view from the room (provided it's not rainy) and the chill vibes at the pool.
Activities - Tip: Do not depend on the culturist to call you back, insist that the person on the hotline makes the activity booking immediately for you.
Called up the hotline 2 weeks in advance to try to book the activities and in the first 2 calls made, I was promised that a culturist would call back in 24 hours which didn't happened. Third time I called which was 1 week before my stay, I was told that the culturists were busy and that they would call me back in 24 hours. Told the person on the hotline that I just want to book the activities and do not trust that the culturist would call back. Person on hotline then informs me that only boba-making and heritage tour slots are available, all others are full booked. Quite disappointed at this point.
Birthday celebration - Do not expect much from Capella, only 3 balloons and 3 pieces of chocolates offered.
I informed the person on hotline that this was a birthday celebration who said they will make a note on the booking. Was worried they would forget so I reminded them again at check-in. Arrived in the room to see 3 balloons on the bed. Subsequently, in the evening, found a glass jar containing 3 small pieces of chocolate with a 'happy birthday' choc message. Called up hotline to check if this was all - she said she would get back to me but never did.
Maybe because I've been spoilt at other hotels where a cake is served on birthdays, sometimes with a complimentary glass/bottle of wine. But the 'surprise' from Capella was really underwhelming.
The Living Room afternoon tea - Tip: Go at 2.45pm if not you might need to wait aat least an hour
Good options for teas but coffees served are dispensed from a machine, not barista made. Good variety of savoury and sweet snacks served. Staff seem like they try to avoid eye contact and always walk quickly which gives you the impression that they don't quite want to be serving you. Also seemingly short of staff. Had to ask 3 times just to get a napkin as they had only provided 1 napkin for 2 of us. I think the idea of afternoon tea is nice but the dining experience was not pleasant.
Others
Sound system is awesome which makes staying in the room even more enjoyable.
Little details seem to be missed - glasses in room were not cleaned, there were still coffee stains on the plate the next day. Toilet seat in room is not aligned with toilet bowl which made it quite uncomfortable. There was an ice bucket provided on the first night at turn down service, but not on the second night.
Overall
The price paid for the room was probably for the exclusivity (lesser people), seaview and location. If you value these, I would say go for it. But if you're particular about the little details and are expecting personalised service, I would suggest that you tamp down the expectations and you would enjoy the experience more. Not sure I would come back again because at 75% capacity the experience was already not optimal.",Date of stay: September 2020,,3,,,,,,,,Tiong Bahru,,

Prior to check in, Culturist Sophia has already contacted us to check if we needed anything else and if we wanted to attend activities conducted in-house. My friends and I signed up for a Boba class. Booking was easy and prompt.
Upon check-in, Taufiq was charismatic while processing it and showed us to our room. Was so excited to see the room & upon entering, we were amazed by the wonderful sea-view & was asked if we drove, thereafter, complimentary parking coupon was provided.
We then proceeded to Bob's Bar for our complimentary drinks with Murni serving us . Pool view was perfect under the sun-set ambience and peacocks running around which we don't commonly see in the city. Felt relaxed and comforting after having their self-concocted drink. These made me feel that I'm in bintatn or bali, a place out of Singapore after the long hiatus of CO-VID19.
Dinner at The Knolls was good, service staff (Lai Yong / Swen & Canny) were attentive to our orders and always offering to top up our drinks. Breakfast the next day was at the same restaurant with the same service provided as dinner. Array of breakfast choices to pick from and we had laska prata and others. A must have will be the prata and laska, never had a prata this crispy elsewhere before.

From arrival, we were greeted politely by all staff.
Front desk communicated well with The Knolls and Bob’s Bar, places we had lunch and a smoke before our room was ready. Once done, we were ushered to our wonderful room at 320. Explanation was given about the room and its buttons functionality. There was even balloons at our bed. A nice and simple touch. There was only a few problems which is shower head had a weak water flow, the temperature knob is loose and tv plug was detached from the wall. Other than that, everything was perfect.
Our dining experience at Cassia was good in terms of service. But there were a few items that are good for improvement which are corner sofa seat is soft which made the table too high for comfort and the table leg was huge that not much space for feet to be placed firm. I’m these are not issues that can be rectified over night but its a good FYI.
Staff at The Knolls were hardworking and we know they worked tirelessly due to the fact we saw them just the night before from other outlets. Auntie Lau Hoon and Darren (from leasing) made us very comfortable with their great attitude and friendliness. This is what service should be and we are grateful to be enjoying such service. Darren even made a printed cup of coffee with our picture on it. A special touch.
We enjoyed Spa massage before leaving and we thoroughly enjoyed the massage. Worth every penny spent. The masseuse were very professional and managed to ensure we were walking out with relax, loose muscles. My with had a bad shoulder and they managed to fix it. Perfect!

Everyone is allowed to use the pool beds for max of 2 hours unless there is no demand so you will definitely get your chance! Special mention to Wayne, Viknesh and his team at the pool. They recognised us immediately from our first stay in August and came over to say hi and made sure we were well taken care of (with loads of aperol spritz and mimosa) =p
Capella Singapore is one of the few hotels in Singapore that allows you to bring in your pet to stay for free! They gave our schnauzer, Baxter a sleeping mat, a drinking bowl and cartons of water. He had such fun over the last two stays with us!
Lastly, a big shout out to the kind gentleman at the front desk Mr Rodolf Catubig. He attended to us for our check-in during the first stay in August and actually remembered Baxter's name when we came back in September again! He was always attentive to our needs and tried to find us the best deals available for us for our next bookings. He went the extra mile to make us feel at home, and thats exactly what we mention to our friends when we talk about Capella Singapore, our second home!",Date of stay: September 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Tiong Bahru,,

Capella Singapore,DTN,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/02dtwl,,DTN wrote a review Sep 2020,1 contribution,Almost Perfect... If not for...,"Just spent 3 nights at the One-bedroom Villa. It was a great size for our family (2 Adults, 2 children). Service was great and up to expectations - especially the breakfast team at the Knolls (they were really warm, welcoming, attentive, and efficient!). My toddler loved the buggy rides and so we took that pretty often. A special mention and thanks to Fandi - He was on duty at the lobby for all the nights we were there and from the 2nd night onwards, whenever he spotted us from afar at the end of the corridor, he would prepare the buggy in advance and drive us back to our villa (he even remembered which villa we were at).
Unfortunately, 2 incidents marred what would have been a perfect stay. First, housekeeping rang the doorbell for turndown service even though we had turned on the Do Not Disturb light. They apologised and explained that the light might not have been working hence they could not see it. When we brought up the issue to front desk, we were given a physical Do Not Disturb sign to hang on our door. Second, while we were in our villa in the afternoon, a staff came into our outdoor terrace unannounced from among the bushes (no doorbell rang) and said he was tasked to cleaned the pool. We alerted front desk and they got back to us promptly after conducting investigation, but the damage was done - our privacy was compromised.
So if you really value privacy, do ask for a physical Do Not Disturb door sign and make sure that the doors to the outdoor terrace are always locked with blinds drawn (or reconsider staying in a one-bedroom villa).",Date of stay: September 2020,,4,,,,,,,,Tiong Bahru,,

Huge room with high ceiling facing the sea. Smooth and friendly check-in process. Shortly after checking into the room，my son's spectacles broke at the hinge. When brought to the reception, the manager, Paul, was kind enough to seek help from his engineering team. The spectacles were fixed and delivered to my room. Impeccable service. Kudos to Paul and the engineering team! During our stay, on few occasions, we sighted a family of 4 peacocks on the hotel premise. Guests are able to use the tennis court and table tennis at the residence clubhouse, subject to availability. The hotel is close to the quiet side of Palawan Beach via flights of stairs,near the pool. Oh yes, the Bose bluetooth sound system in the room is superb (btw, the room is 'soundproof') and toiletries provided are of good quality - Aesop!

The hotel is set on spectacular sprawling grounds and the cascading 3 tier pool feels like you could be in a Bali jungle. Our room was beautiful overlooking Palawan beach and the sea. My only complaint would be that with such beautiful views from the balcony they should really have sunbeds or comfy sofa instead of the cold stone bench. Bit of a design flaw here. Although you pay almost an arm & a leg for the stay, it's all the small details and complimentary services that make it all worth the price, and also sets Capella apart from other hotels.

The lady who made our room made sure to leave an ice bucket at the room when she saw a champagne bottle lying around. The knolls staff couldn’t have been nicer. Mr. Vignesh offered us champagne and made sure to arrange even inroom dining options at the restaurant as we are vegetarians and our options were limited otherwise. Ms Swen made sure to co-ordinated with the chef and arranged different vegetarian options for us to dine through our stay . She even kept the best tables ready for us based on our previous preferences for every meal. She wanted to make sure our 5th anniversary was perfect.

Capella Singapore,Ninjiom,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Ninjiom,Singapore,Ninjiom wrote a review Sep 2020,143 contributions,Not for families,"We just concluded our 3D2N stay in Capella. Our family of four bought the Sentosa staycation package. Premier garden King room. Our kids, 7yo and 3yo.
Pros:
Room is big with high ceiling. There is a balcony, which offers half sea view half garden view. Imagine 0-90degree garden view, 90-180degree is sea view. Bathroom is huge. Aesop toiletries.
Suggestions for improvement to make it a more six star premium experience
1. First thing that I personally do is to swap my shoes into in-room slippers. But I can’t find the slippers, had to pull out each drawer in the room and finally, found it in the walk in wardrobe drawer which is more than half way into the room. Perhaps in-room slippers could be placed at the doorway for ease of changing?
2. They prepared a welcome covid pack. Within it there is one adult mask, one hand sanitizer, two disinfectant wipes. — this is definitely not provided during non-covid period, so if they prepared this, it’s out of goodwill as spare for us. However, I feel that if you intend to impress guests with this spare covid ammunition, you should do it better. There are four pax in the room, instead of one adult mask, prepare two adult masks and two kids masks. Tailor it to the hotel guests within the room! What’s so special about this pack when it prepared half heartedly. Imagine going on a plane ride, u paid tickets for four pax, but they only give out one warm towel for one family to share. How would you feel? Fact: we didn’t use the spare mask at all. I just wanted to say, it’s either u do a better job, or don’t put the pack there at all. It doesn’t impress.
3. Sleeping eye shield/mask: provided for one pax. For same reasons above, if you intend to impress, give it to all pax in the room, at least the adults. I wonder if it’s a couple staying, do you also prepare just one?
4. Welcome fruit pack. The fruit is dragon fruit. Two pieces. Instead of placing them in a plate that’s all, cling wrap them. Let us feel that they have been washed/cleaned/ protected from dust. Rather than naked on the plate. Since you are operating not at maximum capacity, I presume not all the rooms are used daily. I was thinking whether the fruits were sitting there for v Long already before we came.
5. Welcome cookies, M&M and candies for kids. Suggestions, swap them for healthier options like yoghurt candies, Ribena, vitamin C pastilles. As a mum, I don’t like it when people shove junk food to my kids. What about giving small plush toys/ key chains/ small colouring sets? Still better than sweets n chocolates.
6. King bed is too soft for me. I literally sinked into the bed. On the contrary, the day bed was firm and springy.
7. Toilet — I stayed with three males. The toilet is not designed for any privacy during bathing. The toilet has a huge door that cannot be locked. Within the toilet, there r three areas. Bath tub against the window, beside it, the wash basins, then toilet bowl, lastly shower area. Shower area has no door. It’s open, walk in shower and then walk out. Water will splash into the walkway when we shower. So if my two kids are playing in the bathtub, I can’t shower. Becos after I shower, I have to reach for my towel which is hanging on the wall in the walkway. I will have to appear naked in front of my boys. To some families, this is no big deal. But for me, I have started to teach them what is privacy, and not showing my naked body in front of them. It’s inconvenient.
8. Toilet has v v little hooks. Two outside shower area and two beside bath tub. No hooks for hand towels. No hanging line for wet swim costumes. Don’t ask us to lie them on the stone bench in balcony because they will be blown away by wind/ rain will splatter on them.
9. Toilet has a door. But it’s v heavy and swings outward into the narrow walkway. So if you have kids, you have to be careful not to knock them down when you open it. Also, no bidget in toilet.
10. Taps — the design is like the end of a pole. The tap has to be twisted open. You either leave the tap running then you soap your hands, or, u try to be environmental frenly, turn off tap when soaping hands and end up cursing yourself for being so considerate. It’s impossible to twist open the tap with soapy hands! What’s with this design? What can’t they use normal taps that can be easily turn on/off with a gentle push?
11. Towels - need a QC check. There will be one to two towels within the daily set which has torn hem.
12. Aircon - middle of the night will be warm. We set 23 deg before sleep, it was nice and cold. Middle of night, my sons will be sweating and kicking around. I have to adjust aircon to 22 deg to re-kick start the aircon. We didn’t switch off the aircon before sleep, there was NO auto-mode. So it’s the aircon problem. 2nd night, we set 22 deg before sleep, middle of night 2.30am warm again. I had to set it to 21 deg C.
13. We paid premium price but basic service not provided. 2nd day, no make up of room in the day. We left for BF, came back pick up our things and left for sea aquarium. Returned at 1.30pm, room not made up! I called housekeeping, there wasn’t any effort to appease the customer. First, tried to ascertain if we used DND. I said no, then just said she will send Housekeeping over. No apologies or explanation why it was not done up! 1.50pm I called again, Housekeeping not here yet. She said she will expedite it. When I asked why we pay for 6 star hotel but room was not even made up? She said she dunno. Again no apologies and jus said she will expedite it for us. She sounded frustrated with me. Why? We have kids using diapers, lots of trash that is not emptied. Toilet w wet floor, wet carpets. I wanted to let my younger one take a nap. But the room wasn’t ready and still in a mess. Anyway, we decided not to wait just left the room for tea. When we came back at 3.30pm, room still not made up. Finally when we came back from beach at 5pm, it was made up! Turn down service was at 6.30pm? I mean if you are understaffed, let the guests know upfront that you can’t manage making up room on daily basis. Its disappointing to pay so much premium compared to normal 4-5 star hotel but not basic service not even delivered
14. Bell boy volunteered to bring our luggage to our room on first day. On last day, no one came or offer to bring our luggage to lobby. One staff came to deliver invoice to us. The speed which he arrived was much faster than housekeeping, maybe becos it’s money related. He left seeing our luggages on the cooridoor but didn’t ask if we needed help. Its no big deal shifting our own luggages but jus disappointed that they did t bother to leave a good impression.
Others
- “Peranakan pattern workshop” is a fancy name for canvas painting. Suggest to just change the name to canvas painting to avoid misleading guest that we are going to make some craft related to “peranakan design”.
- Don’t expect too much from tea. Basic sandwich like kaya sandwich, Nutella sandwich, cranberry scone.
- The layout of room is not the same as that on Internet
- Beach is not within vicinity. So families with kids have to factor this in. A little inconvenient esp when the beach is fenced up, need to walk one more stretch after walking within Capella, to reach the beach’s entrance.
Conclusion
- No wow factor
- Will we stay again if there isn’t a 20% discount staycation package? No.
- Will we stay again if the 20% package is still available? No.",Date of stay: September 2020,,2,,,,,,,,Tiong Bahru,,

I must applaud Mr Fernando, the GM and his team for keeping up to their superb service like before and making our anniversary so memorable.
Returning to the Capella felt like home, we have been avid fans of the Capella brand since years ago and each time we return we bring back new experiences. During Covid times like this the hotel makes the effort to fine tune activities to suit the current situation making sure social distancing is practiced at all times, despite the crowd they are still able to make you feel exclusive.
We were blessed with a complimentary upgrade to the Capella suite with an early check-in and late check-out so the money was really well spent. The Cassia was our favorite restaurant in the property, it was an oriental epicurean experience, don't forget to check out the Living Room as well for afternoon tea, kueh lapis is a must while you get to browse through a huge selection of magazines and books.
Recently they have curated a list of activities on a daily basis so that guests have a more wholesome experience, we attended the latte art class which was pretty enlightening as they hired a barista to teach us some simple skills. You can request for canvas boards and paint to do some art in your room/villa too.
Breakfast, sadly, wasn't as interactive anymore because they had to remove the live stations so now you get to select from a menu and servers would bring the food to you, but it was a hearty meal nevertheless.
Most of their guests during this Covid era are locals or expats based in Singapore so the crowd is quite different from the past, but they still keep to a 70% occupancy at the maximum to ensure each guest get all the attention they need.
Many thanks to Mr Fernando who found time to welcome us upon our arrival, Arjay who took care of our needs during our stay, Lai Yong who always made sure we were well fed, William and Rudolph at the front desk who diligently adhered to our numerous requests and everyone else who made our staycay such an awesome one. We're thankful for all of you and the conversations we had during our 2 day stay, learning more about how the Capella coped during this pandemic.
See ya all soon, we'd be back for sure because it's the only hotel I'd consider for a staycay in Singapore!

The grounds were beautiful and well maintained. Because this is a staycation for “local tourists”, there were some activities planned such as Boba making workshops which were casual and lots of fun. But this time around, we noticed the rooms though still beautiful and spacious, were slightly dated. Would have also appreciated a smart TV in the room where we could access Netflix. Also the privacy screens for the WC and bathrooms were semi see-through, so you can’t turn on the lights inside without flashing your roommate(s).

There were lots of extra touches like bouquets of flowers for each of us when we checked in so I was really looking forward to our family staycation with my husband & 19 month old toddler.
Unfortunately the experience this time was very hit & miss when it came to the service. When we checked in our room was by some noisy construction so we asked to switch villas. This took a long time to coordinate with multiple follow ups to get us a buggy to the new villa. The new villa didn’t have the high chair and cot we had requested for our son so I had to call guest relations again to get these sent to the room. We were offered a late check out & the bar tab was picked up on our first night because of the inconvenience but I wouldn’t expect a 5* luxury resort to not at least pre-warn guests about possible construction & reduce the price if this is the case.
Breakfast on the first day was great. It is now a la carte so definitely not the same value for money as the buffet but the selection was good and the food tasty. However on the second day the service in the restaurant for breakfast was super slow & the food average. The eggs I had were way too salty & the breakfast was missing items off the menu that were supposed to come with the dish.
Due to Covid-19 restrictions you need to call guest relations a lot to go to the main swimming pool & restaurants etc. This can’t be helped however it would only be on the 4th or 5th time of calling that someone would pick up so they obviously can’t cope with the demand of calls from all of the guests. This I would probably let go at a cheaper hotel but for the price of a room here per night you expect prompt service.
The room size was great and we had our own plunge pool in the villa which I was grateful for as the main swimming pool was at capacity a few times so we couldn’t go in. The massage that I had at the spa was also lovely. The rooms are now a bit dated, particularly some of the Bluetooth and room controls technology which I have seen in some of the other reviews.
Overall the service experience really did not match the price we paid and I found it really inconsistent. I saw other guests receiving really attentive service from some of the management but we weren’t even asked upon check out how our experience was as I was passed between 3 staff members to pay my bill. We wouldn’t stay again although some parts of the the hotel are lovely because we can’t justify the cost for the experience we had.",Date of stay: August 2020,,3,,,,,,,,Tiong Bahru,,

Due to the current situation there is a limit to number of guests in the lobby so we had abit of wait but I guess that cannot be helped. Room is a tad old but we booked the sea view and could see the beach from our room. They had provided us a bigger room as there was availability and the room was prepped for my 2 kids when we arrived. Baby cot and teepee tent!! Which was such a nice surprise!! Felt so personalized and special. Even had baby amenities like soap and an extra fridge for us to store baby food during the stay. The kids (shallow) pool is small but cappella has floats for kids so we could use the deeper pool as well. There is a small short flight of stairs near the pool area to Palawan beach so its convenient to head to beach from the property. We got lost while searching for those stairs but Taufik came to the rescue and helped us back from the residence area to the hotel on a buggy. Best to ask staff for advise if anyone is planning to walk to the beach. Breakfast ala carte menu was great, stoke high chair for kids made breakfast time very easy on us. We were greeted by peacocks and some birds. Aunty Hoon and Jaswan was always kind to my kids when we were at breakfast and when using the pool. Generally all the staff were really really friendly. We will not forget Uncle tham who soothed my son who was having a melt down by taking us on a short buggy stroll. Indeed a very memorable and fun stay for my little family. Staycation with kids are not easy. But in Cappella its possible!!!!!! Would love to return if we get the chance. Thank you Cappella and keep up the good work cos your staff are ALL really great. We wished we could ask everyone’s names but it was impossible...!!!!",Date of stay: September 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Tiong Bahru,,

Having said that, it’s still one of the best experiences during the pandemic. It is also a nice touch of to have the culture tour in the hotel. However, these are some of my feedback for improvements.
While Capella Sentosa is still one of the best hotel on the island, it’s time to keep up to date in terms of technology facilities provided to its guest.
1) still analog tv so it’s not HD nor smart tv to stream Netflix or Bluetooth
2) while there are powerpoints, no USB ports for phone charging nor wireless charging so it gets quite irritating when these days, we have many gadgets to power.
The daily tea at the guest lounge is quite simple too with not much daily variety. It’s always the same scones, cakes, white bread sandwiches on a good day or cheaper kaya sandwiches and some cakes on simpler weekdays. You can kinda guess what they are serving after staying there for 4 nights. Banana cake is good though.
The in-room dining should improve too. I ordered the club sandwich and I must say it’s a little underwhelming for that price. It’s very simple thin deck of sandwich with a few strips of fries. No table cloth or nice tray with flower of sort. The sandwich is enough for one person but compared to other hotels, it’s really small in portion.
The worst would have to be it’s bathrobes. We are normal size asians (can’t imagine someone larger, fatter or caucasians!) but it’s already so so tight fit ,rough and uncomfortable even to wear it in the daytime. It’s not advisable to wear it to sleep for sure. I think it shrunk during washing. We requested to change it but only to be replaced to the small ones after housekeeping. I think the hotel have to look into this.
Expectations should be met since it is still the most expensive hotel on Sentosa.",Date of stay: August 2020,,4,,,,,,,,Tiong Bahru,,

The rooms were enormous with a lot of natural light and the best view we've had in Singapore. Similarly the pool setting was serene, surrounded by trees and it really felt like you were in the jungle in Bali, rather than in Singapore.
Unfortunately the Chinese restaurant Cassia was not open on the days we were staying, but the Knolls and pool food were great. Excellent steak and fish in the knolls, large selection of breakfast food and the usual tasty snacks and meals by the pool. The poolside team were great and Kalai in particular went out of his way to make sure everything was taken care of. I also have to mention Darren and Connie who worked at the Knolls for dinner. Darren, the Sommelier, was very knowledgeable and kindly allowed us to try several of the wines on offer both before and after our meal, as well as providing stellar advice on pairing choices with our food. Connie was always on the ball, remembering both that it was my partners birthday and also our drinks preferences for dessert, such that they brought out a birthday cake and drinks for us both on my partners birthday. A lovely touch that will not be forgotten.
We will certainly be working out when we have another excuse to splash out and return!",Date of stay: August 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Tiong Bahru,,

I would like to thank Viknes from Knolls restaurant. He was absolutely a delight to talk to and he provided so many treats for my 3 year old. I would also like to thank Raymond ( I hope I got his name right) from Cassia but was at Knolls that night too for the amazing service till the next day.
And also not forgetting Abijit from room service. He played with my 3 year old and he brought some surprises for him and it made my boy so happy.
And lastly, the buggy car driver, Mr Azahar for his patience and care towards my family during the buggy rides!
The villa itself was costly but it was worth every penny. A separate en-suite with the master bedroom and living room just one to two steps away. Surrounded by our own good sized plunge pool, and outdoor bath and shower as well!

Capella Singapore,Gerald,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/geraldsh,,Gerald wrote a review Aug 2020,4 contributions,Excellent Staycation,"I was feeling very nervous days before the staycation as I read reviews for other Singapore hotels that they were being swamped and unable to cope due to possibly reduced manpower and covid measures e.g. buffet breakfast becomes buffet a la carte breakfast. Furthermore, I was supposed to be contacted by someone before my arrival but no one contacted me.
Fortunately, all my worries were put to ease when I arrived at the hotel. The check-in was a seamless process. The staff were all smiling and very attentive. They were all well-coordinated with their mic/earpiece to inform each other if a guest was going to one place or another and also to request for assistance for the guest.
Even at breakfast, where they were running buffet a la carte style, food came quickly. Staff went around tables often enough to get additional food orders. I never felt that I had to wait to order food or to receive food. I think there were many non-F&B staff chipping in to help make breakfast a smooth experience for the guests. I saw pool attendants and non-Knolls staff all helping to serve guests.
I would like to give special thanks to,
* Arjay - it was not my first time meeting him actually, he helped me with my takeaway food order during circuit breaker.
* The culturist who showed me to my room and whom I bumped into and chatted with often but I never got his name.
* The pool attendants especially the one serving the adults-only pool, I saw him helping with breakfast too!
* Wilbur who ran the heritage tour.
* The breakfast staff - they were mostly the same faces every single day I was there.
* Selva the bar supervisor who was very friendly and helpful and his staff
* The staff running the BYOB class
I hope I did not miss out anyone!
One nitpick though - could we have better welcome amenities than dragon fruits and some nice chocolates for turn down rather than the mentos like sweets? :)

Service:
I booked the Constellation Room with Sea View for 2 nights with a friend. Upon arrival at 3pm+, our Culturist, Rina, told us that our room was not ready yet because it was raining heavily before and they were cleaning the jacuzzi. Due to that, we were compensated with a $100 additional voucher which I really appreciate.
During the check-in, she also noticed that my friend's birthday was that week (in her IC). She initiated that she would arrange to have a birthday cake and balloons delivered to our room the next day (which was something we never thought of requesting). That itself made my friend super happy and I'm really glad for this personal touch.
Booked myself a massage at Auriga spa. The therapist was very friendly and made me feel comfortable that I nearly doze off during my session!
Our last day, we went for a floral arrangement workshop, led by Dora. We were the only 2 guests who attended the session, so it felt like a private lesson entirely curated for us. :) Being someone who loves flowers, it was definitely a fun learning experience!
Hotel:
Even though it was pricy, I felt that it was definitely worth the money. Some things are even priceless.
The room was on the 5th floor, facing the sea. From the balcony, the view of the swimming pool, forest and the sea was incredible. Doesn't matter day or night, it was so picturesque that we were so sad to leave. Waking up to this view every morning through the big glass windows is definitely something to die for.
The priceless moment was when I saw a hornbill perch onto the balcony. It's also amazing when the cool sea breeze touching our skins while laying down under the night sky during our late night chats.
However, there was one strange thing regarding their housekeeping. We ordered room service, which was 2 glasses of mojitos on our first night. The housekeeping staff cleaned the whole room, EXCEPT for those two glasses throughout the entire stay. I don't understand why..
Also, I do wish that there were more Halal certified restaurants within the vicinity of the hotel. That would make our lives much easier :)

Thank you for always making us feel welcome to our second home in Sentosa … nothing beats the familiarity and feeling of returning home. 😊 This experience would not be possible with the excellent and meticulous planning by the team which have accompanied us throughout this journey.

Few days prior to our check-in date, culturist contacted me to check on some details like our time of arrival, my partner & kid's name or if we are celebrating any especial occasion during our stay, she even explained to me the hote safety measures in terms of like pool & gym usage and the maximum number of pax allowed.. I did received an email as well with the list of resort activities that the hotel offers, which is a very good touch as we managed to plan the activities in advance.
Myself and my family enjoyed the activities that the hotel offers like Bubble tea making, peranakan painting as well as Canvas painting for the kids while enjoying the afternoon tea in living room.

As we’d been living/working/schooling at home for last 5 months, we decided to splurge and treat ourselves with a luxury villa stay at Capella last week. Given we were paying $3,500/night we were expecting awesome service - instead it was the opposite. Throughout there were a series of issues which left us very frustrated. Almost every staff interaction was poor, complacent and inconsistent - no one seemed to really cared.
Some issues included:
* 6 calls and discussions over 7 hours to get access to the gym - getting different answers and excuses
* No welcome note or pack - usual for luxury hotels
* No mini-bar or snacks in room - were told we had to order for room service whenever we wanted anything
* Calls to housekeeping went unanswered, or took a long time to answer and when answered we were told to redial a different number... rather than offer to help
* When orders placed to housekeeping, some items turned up, some did not
* AC not working and lots of lights in the room meant it was bright and hard to sleep on first night
* No decaffeinated coffee
* Phone not working
* No TV guide
* Kids getting offered sweet stuff at every opportunity, without consulting the parents - pushing large portions of sweet food at kids is not fair or appropriate
* Valet driving car with bikes on roof-rack into hanging lights, knocking the bikes off rails
* Different breakfast items on a plate on different days - despite the same menu every day
* Needing to chase up various items at dinner or breakfast, getting 3 glasses for 4 people, kids get a drink one with a straw one without etc Is it because staff are using bits of paper and a pencil to write down orders?
* Getting a 3/4 empty bottle of wine when we ordered a bottle
* Etc etc etc…
Despite all these (and other) issues and our complaints, at no stage did anyone apologise or follow-up. In addition, my email to the hotel outlining these concerns 4 days ago, remains unanswered. All re-enforcing the sense that no one cares about service at Capella.
You’d expect this kind of service from a 1or 2 star hotel, not for $3,500 per night at one of (apparently) best hotels in Singapore! You'd think Capella would be trying even harder to keep customers happy during CV-19... clearly not!

E.g. he noticed that we liked to be in the shade and volunteered to shift the umbrella at our lounger twice even without us asking. Really left a positive impression. One slight complaint would be when we requested for ice on our first night. We called the reception twice, once at 10pm and once at 1020pm and our ice bucket never came with no follow up whatsoever: not very acceptable at this price point.

I went in with high expectations as Capella Singapore has won numerous awards and I must say that it really is very deserving of its achievements as an ultra 5-star luxury hotel! A very big ""Thank you"" to the hotel's General Manager Fernando Gibaja and his team for such a fantastic experience and making us feel at home, a luxurious home!
1. Personalized service and attention
Upon knowing that it was my husband's belated birthday, the team made an effort to decorate the room with our photos, some balloons, a delicious New York cheesecake (my husband's favourite) and even a bottle of champagne for us to celebrate his special occasion!
There was a teepee set up for our 2 little boys and the team brought over additional kids' refreshments such as milk packets, yogurt and cheese sticks for them to enjoy. It was such a thoughtful gesture which I truly appreciated.
We were also greeted by the GM himself when we arrived, as well as for breakfast and I must say it was a really nice personal touch! Several staff also called us by name and it was really very sweet of them to remember us.
2.Cleanliness, hygiene and safety
Even with Covid-19 restrictions in place, the luxury hotel was running very smoothly with safe entry check-ins in place and very high standards of hygiene and cleanliness wherever we go.
Breakfast had 4 staggered timings for guests to choose from so that we could enjoy our breakfast without worrying about a large number of guests in the restaurant.
3. Excellent service and food
The service provided was absolutely fantastic. Housekeeping came by to tidy up the Manor while we were away at breakfast without us requesting for it, there was a turndown service when we returned back after dinner, and there were nice little touches like putting orchids on the fresh clean towels. In addition, the team was always prompt and helpful whenever we requested for something, such as a baby cot and additional blankets and pillows. Our children also had kids' toiletries - GAIA natural baby toiletries and kids' dental kits - provided for them. Such a thoughtful gesture for our little ones!
The Ala carte buffet at The Knolls also had high quality food with ample selection, with international cuisine such as a variety of eggs and toast, freshly baked bread as well as local favourites such as laksa, chicken curry and noodle soup. Perfect for my husband who can't do without his Asian food! We enjoyed the breakfast with attentive service staff.
We also had a great dinner at The Knolls - my husband ordered the lamb (cooked perfectly!) and I had the cabonara linguine. The chocolate lava cake was absolutely divine as well!
I would definitely recommend Capella Singapore to anyone looking for a fabulous stay with personalised service. It truly was an ideal place to relax and rejuvenate. Most of all, we appreciated the personal touch and service. Kudos to the team led by the GM for helping us to create such wonderful memories!",Date of stay: August 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Tiong Bahru,,

From the moment we arrived, we were greeted warmly at the Lobby Reception Area by Front Desk Manager, Peggy.
We were allocated a Junior Suite with breathe taking views overlooking the hotel’s Swimming Pool and South China Sea. The suite was very spacious with ceiling height sliding doors separating the Living Room from the Bedroom. There were 2 separate huge wardrobes for both genders, well lighted heritage bathroom fixtures unique to a heritage hotel, spacious bathroom space for a rejuvenating Rainforest Ceiling Shower and a bath tub with spectacular sea view.
Service Staff were very well trained and discreet as they delivered to our room – Rose Bouquet, Champagne, Fruit Platter, Afternoon Tea Set with a good selection of gourmet tea leaves.
We had late lunch at The Knolls where we were given a window seat table – the Grilled Rib Eye Steak was very tender and juicy, served with special selection of bread and croquette.
In the evening, we had dinner at Cassia Cantonese Restaurant. The Suckling Pig Platter and Wok Fried Wagyu Beef were the highlights of our meal.
An after dinner drink at Bob’s Bar was the perfect spot to end an evening in this old world charm hotel.
The evening turn down at our hotel room was a surprise Rose Petal Bath, Heart Shaped Decoration of Rose Petals on our bed, both our names were embroidered on the Bathrobes and Pillow Cases.
In-room breakfast dining was a very pleasant experience too – Front Office Staff, accepted our dining requests cheerfully and food was delivered to our room very shortly. Staff laid out our sumptuous Breakfast beautifully on the spacious coffee table.

Please note that they limit the number of people in the wet area so safe distancing measure and it’s only available by booking so please do book in advance.

Unfortunately, nearing the end of our stay, we were left with a bitter aftertaste which sticks out like a sore thumb in an otherwise wonderful experience....
2 weeks prior, I explicitly mentioned to the reservation team that we would prefer our breakfast to be send to our room at 10 a.m on 15th Aug 2020. (That’s becos Knolls isn’t dog friendly). They acceded to our request and promised that it had been arranged for.
However, on 15th Aug @ 1041 a.m, we made a call to the hotel operator when our breakfast still hasn’t arrived...
To my surprise, we were told that no such arrangement was made prior...
After much dilly dallying, breakfast finally arrived at 1148 a.m, just in time for our lunch!!
TBH, all these time & effort WASTED could have been easily avoided...IF ONLY, the reservation team had carried out their responsibilities dutifully in the first place...
Lastly, I reckon that a reputable establishment such as Capella Hotel, which prides itself in exceptional customer service & experience, can learn and improve from this totally avoidable incident.

Location is so convenient just above Tanjong Pagar MRT and area has plenty of food choices. (Highly recommend Keisuke Hamburg just across the Hotel)
Service and ambience in the Hotel is top notch, it is a class above. Love how they use gigantic bears to socially distance, instead of ugly big Xs in other places. The pool area is small but lovely to hang out at. It is so tranquil that it's hard to believe we are in the middle of the CBD. The great view and instagram worthy backdrop is a bonus!
We had dinner at Racines and Afternoon Tea at 1846. Food was superb at Racines, their Crab Fried Rice and Wagyu Cheek was amazing! There was a small hiccup during the meal which we just casually mentioned, but Shankar went above and beyond to rectify it. He really exemplifies great service, please extend our appreciation to him. Drinks at 1846 are fantastic! We had the whiskey sour and espresso martini, both were delicious. Afternoon Tea food were acceptable but again, it is the service that stands out. The staffs were all very attentive in refilling water for the teapot and made genuine efforts to connect with us.
We had the Luxury Room which was clean, spacious and comfortable. It also had a lovely view of the surrounding shop houses. The room is thoughtfully designed and I loved that the towel hanging rack is big enough to hang all of our towels! Service was prompt when we needed more amenities and Housekeeping was kind to bring my child a kid amenity set and bath salt for the adults. The Bed is also sooooo comfortable. The only downside is probably the pillow which was very soft and flat.

Early this morning, I rang the Front Desk and they sent an engineer to check, he came up and said there was a fault in the system and my air-conditioning was off for the entire night. You can imagine my displeasure at paying all this money to sleep in a warm room. I woke up at 5:50am and I had to start working at 9am. I might as well be out somewhere camping, or stay at home with proper air-conditioning.
This morning, I asked the restaurant if they could send up my breakfast to my room, but was treated with a frosty attitude. The Duty Manager tried to save the situation (Imran), still there were more mishaps, my online breakfast order was not captured even though I had placed it in the restaurant, I had to repeat the order on the phone, there was constant ringing at my room phone despite saying I am on Zoom lecture (University lecture). Eventually the breakfast came at approx. 10:30am.
I don't know. It is really a poor experience. I had asked if I could be refunded the night or given 1 more night to make up for the poor experience. Imran offered me a late check-out until 8pm tonight. I had said there was a fault in the system and he said it was my fault for not ringing the reception last night, I thought this was inappropriate after losing sleep, I was seriously exhausted and only went to bed after midnight, and did not think it appropriate to make a complaint past midnight.
I really look forward to your reply and hope you can remedy this situation, clearly something is not working out in this hotel.
I have heard very mixed and bad reviews from friends about the Sofitel Sentosa so I was very hesitant to book it, but now it seems the bad reviews about Sofitel are merited.",Date of stay: November 2020,,2,,,,,,,,Tanjong Pagar,,

Staying at their hotels have so far been amazing, and my stay at Sofitel Singapore City Centre is of no exception.
Booked a one night weekday staycation and was granted early check-in which was efficient and hassle-free. The room was well appointed, clean and comfortable. I had a few requests, which were appropriately followed, especially with regards to certain amenities which are currently only given upon request as part of the hotel’s safety measures. We were also granted late check-out which was rather generous, probably because it was a weekday and the hotel seemed relatively quiet.
Service at all points in the hotel were prompt, professional and friendly. Booking is needed for access to the gym and pool (gym’s pretty small but has the essential machines/weights). The service at Club Millesime was great, although the evening cocktails have been shortened and menu limited as part of safety measures too.
Breakfast at Racines was good too. Limited choices as well, but quality is maintained. Ordering has to be done via an app which sends the orders directly to the kitchen. We availed of the 3-course lunch as well, although most of the dishes were so-so, except for the dessert.
The only downside is the lack of complimentary parking provided to guests as the parking is managed by the building owner (although I’m sure something can be arranged, no?).
Overall, the hotel stay was within expectations, and they have delivered on the Sofitel level of service. Staycation experiences are currently different from before due to safety measures, but the hotel has done its best to make the stay comfortable and still memorable. Would definitely stay again!",Date of stay: October 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Tanjong Pagar,,

We booked their Prestige King Suite which is 76 sqm and comes with a separate living room.
Similar to Andaz hotel, this hotel does not provide complimentary parking for their guests. I checked in at around 3pm and left the carpark at 5.15pm and paid $53 for the charges.
For those who want to drop their family members and luggages, you should do at at their Peck Seah Street drive-way. Drivers can park at level 2 or 3 of the Guocco Tower and take the lift to level 5 of their Hotel Lobby.
We were greeted by Melody, who has been very warmth and helpful in explaining the benefits to us, including the 2 robots that are stationed infront of the lobby whose job is to delivery small items to hotel guest in a contactless manner. The kids were amazed and very welcoming when we received an automated call to inform us that the robot is already outside our room 1112 with our requested amenities. Many thanks to Melody who is our first contact in the hotel and made our day.
Our room includes access to Club Millesime that serves beverages from 7am to 11pm and evening cocktails with canapes from 5pm to 6pm.
Services from Rafida, Adi and the team at level 6 Club Millesime were great. They are a whole bunch of warmth, friendly and attentive team who made our 1hr stay fun and memorable before our dinner. Food is great together with a wide selection of drinks. They will never say no to the requests from the kids and are always willing to offer more.
Breakfast their Level 5 Racines Restaurant is nice too, with friendly services from Beverly, Push, Neilson, and the team, right from the moment we enter, and left happily before we head back to our room and prepare for the pool visit.
Checking out was a breeze too, where we met their Duty Manager who recognized us, sought our feedback for the stay and gave a motherly farewell to the 2 boys who seemed reluctant to part with the robots and the 3 days of fond memories.",Date of stay: October 2020,,4,,,,,,,,Tanjong Pagar,,

Utilised my StayPlus Accor Plus benefit, must say it was a good redemption value over that weekend. Allocated to a room on the Club floor, although our room has no club access.
Room:
Pros: Nice room with a touch of luxury feel. Comfy Bed.
Cons: Found a strand of hair at the bathtub when we first entered the room (not ours). Washroom was getting a little old. Most amenities from the room has been removed (e.g. slippers, additional towel, etc.), need to request for them via the phone.
Dinner: Fantastic food quality and Accor Plus Dining benefit. Although it was during the National Day period, this hotel went above and beyond to extend the APlus dining benefit on the eve of National Day and National Day (for the breakfast) itself.
Breakfast: Wide selection of breakfast options, however, the portion of the food was not clearly disclosed upon ordering. Ended up over-ordering too much food, and resulted in not able to try a wide variety of food. Feedbacked to the waiter, and he says they are aware of the issue and is looking to resolve it soon. Value for money, after factoring in the Accor Plus 50% dining benefit, as the breakfast is an ala-carte buffet style.
Overall Experience: I would say it is an above-average and expected stay experience, but certainly not phenomenal. Accor Silver status late checkout was not honoured, although after feedbacking on the in-room TV, the front desk called to extend checkout to 1 pm for 1 room only (we had 2). Welcome drinks for Accor Silver members was appreciated - they don't discriminate against lower-tier Accor members by limiting the drink options - everything on the menu is available.",Date of stay: August 2020,,4,,,,,,,,Tanjong Pagar,,

From the point of making a reservation, the very attentive reservations team had already reached out for pre-arrival preferences and provided a nice complimentary baby cot for the little one. They also provided me with a nice room upgrade to ensure we have enough space for the baby to play.
Club Lounge experienced was impeccable - every one of them served us with a smile and gave us the fullest attention but Daniel stood out the most for helping us with some requests and continued to bring us the never-ending amount of drinks and food (ha!). They have replaced the buffet in the club lounge with small ala carte canepes but you'll never feel that it's inadequate.
On check-out we had a couple of drinks at the 1854 bar and gosh were they awesome! The barrel aged Manhattan is smooth (and lethal!) and their signature Monique cocktail is so refreshing everyone should try during the stay. Services is perfect especially from the bar manager and Michael the bartender. Like mentioned by others, breakfast is ala carte buffet and lets you walk away feeling like a significantly more luxurious meal.
The pool and gym are by appointment only to manage the crowd; it's so well controlled and makes us feel save and comfortable i could only wish hotel pools and gym should remain this way always!

As a Accor Platinum, Its very nice for Sofitel to allowed me to check-in at 1030am and checkout after 4pm. Maria from the front desk made an effort to call me before I leave home for Sofitel around 9am to inform that my room is ready.
Checkin was efficiently done, room was upgraded to the club floor and informed on the club lounge happy hour timing which is a bit short to my liking (6-7pm)probably due to Covid-19.
Room was squeaky clean, bed is comfortable, and working desk is large enough for me to work for the day. Just that some in room amenities like paper and stationeries were removed, and I have to call to request to get them back.
Pool and gym are both clean and well maintain.
Breakfast and lunch at Racine was also very enjoyable.

Sofitel Singapore City Centre,jh_chua,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/jh_chua,"Singapore, Singapore",jh_chua wrote a review Aug 2020,21 contributions,"So comfortable, you won't want to leave.","Absolutely charmed by this lovely hotel located in one of the most hip neighbourhoods in the CBD. Booked myself into the deluxe room under Klook's staycation package and was totally impressed.
Due to the COVID19 situation, I received an email a day before confirming my check-in time, room amenities required (now provided on-request only), and also provided a host of information relating to my stay.
Your experience begins when you step through the glass doors at the main entrance. The lobby is located on the 6th floor and a separate lift will take guests to their rooms. Staff were warm and accomodating, and check-in was quick and easy. I was assigned a room on a premium floor as I had asked for a high floor (Thank you, Sofitel).
The room was absolutely luxurious and it was spotless. Everything was sparkling clean; the staff had clearly paid attention to details. The bathroom was what you would expect from a 5 star luxury hotel: the WC, rain shower and bathtub were all separate. The Lanvin toiletries are my personal favourite.
Room size was rather big, with plenty of space to move around. The king sized bed was very comfortable and provided me with a very good night's rest. There was plenty of well placed power sockets (3-pin and USB) in the room, something which not all hotels get right. There were also TWG teas and a Nespresso machine provided.
Service was top notch in this hotel. Every staff I encountered was immaculately groomed and had a positive service attitude. I had dinner and breakfast at the Racines Restaurant and experienced the same great service. Again, due to COVID19, there was no buffet-style breakfast. I was given a choice of sets, and while the food did not disappoint, I felt that the presentation had room for improvement.
I enjoyed my stay so much I am contemplating to stay here again soon. The whole place gave me a very upscale feel and was so comfortable I didn't feel like leaving at all. In fact, I would not have stepped out of the hotel if I didn't need to get food nearby. Well done Sofitel, and a big 5 stars for this stay.",Date of stay: July 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Tanjong Pagar,,

Despite the safe management measures, the amenities (like the Hermes toileteries) were all there and if they were not, you could call to request for them (like pillow choice, bedroom slippers). The Millesime lounge service was still good as before, despite the limited timing (6-7pm,) and no buffet evening cocktails. You could order ala carte for the snacks and drinks. This applied to the breakfast. No buffet spread but the unlimited ala-carte more than made it for it. Also had dinner at the Racines, and even with the limited menu, the quality was still there.

It has the advantage of being reasonably easy to access a lot of the touristy elements of Singapore, while being relatively quiet in the evenings - notwithstanding the queues for several local restaurants. We had a club room for three nights with a Luxury Escapes deal. The club itself is wonderful. There’s an outdoor area overlooking a lush mini-garden and the pool which is a great spot to sit and enjoy the complimentary champagne in the evenings, plus some very good snacks.
It was a shame, due to the Covid-19 issue, that the Club had only the most basic offering for breakfast and we were directed to the main Racines restaurant. This wasn’t at all good. The food offering there seemed markedly reduced and, frankly, it was a bit poor. I realise the locals don’t necessarily want to eat bacon/sausage or hash browns for breakfast but that doesn’t mean these should be barely lukewarm. I had to complain to a supervisor to get anything hot, but the next morning they were back to being weakly warmed under a heat lamp. It was so disappointing, especially given the evening’s food offering in the Club was good. Had the breakfast been decent I would have given this hotel an excellent rating.
Guests who take a club room are also entitled to use of the nearby Virgin Active health club. It’s rather large and quite impressive as far as the facility goes but one caveat - if you’re looking to participate in particular classes it’s quite hard to get a booking. I managed one day out of three to be able to book in for the workout I wanted. It’s not exactly a great benefit in that regard.
My compliments to the Club Millesime staff who were exceptionally good, especially the lovely Ms Fiqah and Ms Melody, Daniel and Sharen.
I’d very much like to experience the hotel when all facilities were functioning at full strength, including breakfast in the Club.",Date of stay: March 2020,,4,,,,,,,,Tanjong Pagar,,

Conveniently located above Tanjong Pagar MRT Station with direct elevator access from the station to the hotel lobby level, the 223-room property is a short walk away from the Chinatown heritage district, one train stop away from the Central Business District via Raffles Place MRT Station and about twenty minutes away Changi Airport.
OFITEL SINGAPORE CITY CENTRE
The hotel lobby on the 5th level is indisputably the property’s key social destination, housing the hotel’s reception, lounge areas as well as dining concepts Racines and 1864. The space plays it all vibrant botanical and floral motifs with lavish floral centrepieces and soaring floral paintings by Italian artist-in-residence Arianna Caroli. One of the lobby level’s greatest assets is its floor-to-ceiling windows across one end of the lobby which welcome generous streams of natural light which gives the space a significant uplift of energy. Sophie and Xavier, the hotel’s droid butlers which assist with the delivery of room amenities, stand patiently in a corner ready to serve. A guitar player serenades guests with soothing strummed melodies in the lobby during the afternoon and in the evenings, the hotel performs the French traditional candle ritual (a Sofitel signature practice all over the world) after which the entire hotel comes alive with the warm glow of candlelight.
In terms of wellness, guests can take a dip in the jacuzzi pool for some good vibrations or luxuriate in the 30-metre infinity pool, which is surrounded by verdant tropical vegetation, relaxation zones with both singular and couple beds for suntanning or lounging and even an open lawn with private pool cabanas. As the hotel shares pool facilities with the Virgin Active gym within the connected Guoco Tower (see below), the pool is usually fairly crowded with families and couples, but the lush landscape somehow assists in maintaining suitable resort-relaxed vibes in spite of the number of guests around.
Those seeking to soak up a sweat have the option of either using the 24-hour SoFit in-house gym or, in the case of guests in Luxury Premium Rooms and higher categories, taking advantage of the hotel’s partnership with the neighbouring Virgin Active gym, which provides guests complimentary access to the gym’s extensive spread of fitness programmes and equipment. All fitness activities are accessed via the hotel’s 6th floor.
Guests looking for spa treatments can take a complimentary ride to sister property Sofitel Singapore Sentosa Resort & Spa’s luxurious SoSpa for a pampering fix as well as access to further wellness facilities such as SoSpa's private pool.
PRESTIGE SUITE
With floor-to-ceiling windows giving access to sweeping views of the historic Tanjong Pagar enclave with its sea of terracotta roof tiles, the 76sqm Prestige Suite offers quite the zen sanctuary amidst all the downtown hustle and bustle. The suite is immaculately designed, with a quietly confident flamboyance in its purple and floral flourishes. The bedroom’s signature Sofitel MyBed - trademarked, mind you - isn't so much a bed as it is a soft wing which receives your body into its angelic embrace, and there is also a pillow menu which meets the requirements of both soft pillow seekers as well as heavy-cranium Tyrannosauruses. Thoughtfully-positioned bedside USB ports address your night-time device charging needs, while a window-side chaise longue comes with its own table and adult colouring book along with a box of Faber Castell colour pencils for relaxed and artistic/senseless doodling.
The spacious living room is equipped with a 4-seat dining table for your Deliveroo and Foodpanda needs, plush sofa seating, a separate powder room, a 55-inch Smart TV and a Bose entertainment system. The pantry is equipped with a minibar with complimentary snacks and non-alcoholic beverages such as golden pear with aloe vera and coconut water, TWG tea-making facilities as well as a Nespresso Creatista Plus (the first I’ve ever seen in a hotel room thus far) which is capable of preparing latte drinks as well as creating latte art.
The sleek marble bathroom comes with double vanities, an enclosed rainfall shower and a sizeable bathtub with its own mirror TV and a most clever bathtub caddy with a metal rack for holding a book or iPad (each room comes with an actual self-improvement book for your naked spiritual development) as well as a slot which securely holds your wine glass. Suite guests do not get the usual Lanvin amenities but instead get posh Hermès bathroom products.
CLUB MILLESIME
Situated on the 6th level, the Club Millésime provides private check-in/check-out services and serves breakfast, afternoon tea as well as evening cocktails and canapes. The lounge itself is fairly large, with different zones for different needs. Apart from the main seating area with communal dining tables suitable for bigger groups and families, there is a library-esque area for more intimate moments, a repurposed board room for formal meetings and dinners as well as outdoor terrace seating near the pool.
While the buffet selection is fairly limited compared to that offered at Racines, Club Millésime thoughtfully offers an a la carte breakfast set menu past 11am for club guests who need those extra hours of sleep in the morning. The a la carte breakfast selection comprises your choice of eggs, vegetable, toast and add-on such as bacon, smoked salmon or veal sausage.
The evening food presentation is easily the most elaborate and luxurious, featuring a spread of very substantial fare - I have seen Fishcakes, Szechuan Spicy Fried Chicken, Chicken Satay, Vegetarian Fried Rice, Pork Belly with Mustard Cream Sauce and Vegetarian Truffle Pasta across my various visits - as well as a variety of cold cuts, cheeses and sweets such as Banana Chocolate Tart, Earl Grey Crème Brûlée and Yuzu Lychee Jelly with Coconut Juice. The frequent rotation of dishes means you seldom see a repeat dish across your stays, and on occasion new dishes are served instead of the depleted course being replaced so there's always an element of anticipation and excitement.
In terms of booze, the spirit selection is fairly limited, featuring the likes of Ketel One Vodka and Bombay Sapphire Gin, while Duval Leroy champagne is the bubbly of choice. However, the lounge boasts an impressive Enomatic wine dispensing system giving guests self-service and unlimited access to eight different bottles of wine, which should provide guests with ample time to get sufficiently grape-nutritioned for the night by the time 7.30pm comes round.
CONCLUDING THOUGHTS
Despite the disappointing breakfast presentation, the hotel remains one of my favourite properties in Singapore. Apart from being one of the newer hotels around, the guest rooms are very comfortable, the executive lounge has an exciting food selection with a much-appreciated wine dispensing system, the Virgin Active gym access is (rarely used but nonetheless) helpful, and the swimming pool is one you actually want to use.
Quite possibly the best Accor property in Singapore.

The MRT station is literally in this building, so you dont have to walk many steps to get to the train. The service is of 5* quality and the bfast matches this. We had book 3rooms, which were nice and spacious with a shower and bath tub. Wifi everywhere and room service whenever you need it. Hi tech surveillance and access to the rooms, so not just anyone can come to your room unless you share a floor. Very clean and good coffee and tea facilies, bar fridge, make sure you ask them to empty it if you dont want to be charged extra. Really enjoyed our 5nights in this gem.",Date of stay: January 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Tanjong Pagar,,

We stay in a different hotel each time. Sofitel City Centre has been the best of 5 we’ve stayed at. They provided a warm welcome. The room was large, functional and stylish. It had everything we needed for our stay. The infinity pool is big and refreshing although the area could do with more shady trees (think ParkRoyal on Pickering). The hotel is located in Tanjong Pagar and on top of the train station there. We didn’t eat here as there are numerous and diverse range of eateries, restaurants and good coffee shops in the area.

My worries turned out to be very wrong, from the moment we arrived, the hotel staff treated us very well. Pak Fadly whom greeted us by name when we exited from taxi was very kind. He showed us the room and the functionality, it also help that he could speak Malay so that we feel at ease asking questions. Before that, we checked in at the club millesime while waiting our room to be ready and the lounge attendant give us refreshing drinks. She also give us the tour of the facilities which we really appreciated.
The room itself was beautiful. It exudes luxury and chic at the same time. From the books provided, to the magazines, lighting, coloring books and huge sofa showed that the room was very elegant. The bathroom amenities provided by Hermes which we loved and the bathtub becomes my daughter's playground. One minor thing to improve is Hotel could provide some air freshener to remove previous guest scent.
What set the hotel apart is their staff. They went the extra miles by providing decorations and plush toy to celebrate my daughter birthday. Then, they also gave us a scrumptious birthday cheese cake which we enjoy very much.

Staff were all friendly and helpful, with a ""Bonjour"" and a smile every time I saw one, and courteously asking how my foot was (arrived in Singapore with an infected little toe, helped direct us to a medical centre and pharmacy too). Check in was effortless, with the concierge taking care of my bags and directing me to reception (on the fifth floor), reception calling my mother (who had arrived two days earlier) to let her know I was there, then showing me to the elevators. Much appreciated after a long overnight flight from Europe! The whole hotel was spotlessly clean and welcoming, and even if the hallways smelt slightly mouldy (not much ventilation in a humid climate, to be expected), the room and common areas were always fresh and clean smelling. The room was very spacious and well lit (a rarity these days!), with a huge bathroom and bathtub (set up with a tray holding a wineglass and book), comfortable beds, complimentary bottled water/Nespresso coffee/gourmet tea/use of gym bag and mat, turn down service every evening, colouring book and pencils, individually controlled cold airconditioning (a must in Singapore), pillow menu, and was quiet and peaceful. Had breakfast in the restaurant one morning, staff were attentive and selection was vast and great quality (just specify you want tea with milk and not white tea, otherwise you will get white tea leaves!!!). Location was very convenient, located above a MRT stop with eateries, two streets from Chinatown, and a five minute walk to bus stops.

We complemented the chef whom came out and introduced himself personally to thank us.
If this is not a testament that the Sofitel has reached every expectation that we had is definitely an understatement.

Booked through Expedia for my 2 nights stay. Arrive hotel pass midnight and was greeted by the lady concierge Majiah. She assisted me with my huge luggage even when i told her that my luggage was heavier than her (joking manner). She even assisted pressing the elevator for me to the reception for check-in and insisted to sent my luggage to my room. First impression was Wow.
As only 1 counter was open to check-in i have to wait for few minutes for my turn. Check-in experience was fast as i have already paid for my booking. The check-in counter was so dark that i barely can see what i signing on the form. I also realized that the airconditioning was switched off at the Lobby. Really pity the staff who was working at the check-in counter. When i ask the guy at the check-in counter, he confirmed it and told me the aircondition will switch back on in the morning. I was given room on the 8 floor at the right end.
Room is clean and spacious for solo traveller like me. The next day after showering i realised that there a yellow spot on the towel. Towel was changed when they clean my room later.
Breakfast option was just pleasant for a luxury hotel.
Calling the phone operator took ages just to ask for ice. At least 3 attempts before able to get through.
Concierge staff was all friendly since the day i step in the hotel. Always smilling and greeting guests. Special mention to Gary at the concierge for being very helpful and suggestion me to all Tourist Hotspot. He even go the extra mile to inform the driver where im heading to.
Overall stay was nice and i will definely choose Sofitel Singapore should i have the opportunity to came back to Singapore.",Date of stay: December 2019,,4,,,,,,,,Tanjong Pagar,,

Sofitel Singapore City Centre,LizaNTrevor,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/LizaNTrevor,"Melbourne, Australia",LizaNTrevor wrote a review Dec 2019,"1,051 contributions",Fantastic service in a quiet convenient location,"As soon as we got out of the car, a gentleman was there to take our luggage. As we had already checked in online the gentleman had known that we were arriving and said he would arrange to have our luggage taken to our room. He showed us to the lifts to take us to level 6 to check in at the lounge. During check in, we were able to enjoy the canapes in the lounge whilst he sorted out the paperwork. Check out was similarly quick and friendly.
Pros
- Great location with the Tanjong Pagar MRT entrance just next to the hotel. China town is at your door step so eating out is not a problem. There is also a small scattering of shops at the exit of the MRT with a Starbucks just next to the MRT entrance. The convenience of having a MRT right next to/under the hotel can’t be overstated.
- Our Prestige Suite, 1612, had a large living space, a powder room just to the left as you enter the room, walk in robe, massive bathroom with separate tub, shower and toilet all partitioned off by frosted glass doors. The view from the floor to ceiling windows overlooked the red roofs of china town.
- The blinds and black out curtains could be controlled electronically.
- There were USB slots by the bed and in the work desk and were convenient for charging our phones.
- Air conditioning was fantastic and was very quiet.
- Great friendly staff in the executive lounge, porters and breakfast staff at Racines.
Although we had access to the lounge for breakfast we opted for Racines which had a tremendous range of food from western to Asian. We loved the traditional Singaporean deserts!! What a treat. The hot dishes changed every day so there was variety. You can have order omelettes and also have freshly made noodle soup. The breakfast staff were always friendly and cleared away the dishes promptly. All stations were replenished quickly. The juices were great too with guava/dragon fruit a favourite. Coffee was nespresso so not the best.
- Our luggage was brought up to our room whilst we were checking in.
- The hotel was only 2 years old when we visited so it is up to date with the latest technology. Our son loved the fact that there was a television screen in the bathroom window so he could watch TV whilst brushing his teeth. They even had robot butlers which we saw in action one night as it delivered a toy to another guest.
- We had a $20 laundry allowance each night so we were able to have a polo shirt and shorts laundered each night of our stay and this was handled efficiently. A quick call to housekeeping in the morning and leaving the items outside the room and by 7pm the items were left hanging in our walk-in robe.
- As it was our anniversary, we had a lovely card and a delicious cake.
- All day snacks included caramelised pop corn which our son devoured gleefully, Singaporean deserts, chocolate bars.
- Canapes in the evening included a variety of small dishes such as pasta, fried noodles, sushi (a bit dry), fruit and cakes. Champagne, Asahi, teas, soft drinks, juices etc.The staff were always on hand to refill our glasses.
- The lounge is small and intimate and the staff there were very friendly and remembered our names and preferences.
- Lovely Hermes Orange Verte toiletries which was refreshing.
- Wifi worked throughout the room and hotel grounds.
- The infinity pool was fantastic set in a nice “jungle” environment. Our soon loved it. There is a small change room that you can use or you can come down in your bathrobes.
- The club lounge, pool and gym are located on the 6th floor with the lounge looks out on to the pool.
- The small gym was well equipped and there is a cart with freshly made flavoured water. There is also a cold-water dispenser in the gym which we used for topping up our water bottles with chilled water before heading out each day.
- There is a small lobby at the entrance of the hotel that is manned by friendly staff who greeted us every day as we entered and exited the hotel. One of the even offered to take photos of us as we waited for our taxi and explained to us about the ornate chandelier in the lobby.
- Turn down service every night with a different Singaporean cake each night. Yum.
- A digital scale was in the bathroom which we used to weigh our suit cases. We also stayed at the Mandarin Oriental and a scale was not provided and when we asked, house keeping had no idea what it was so we were grateful that Sofitel provided one.
- Beautiful selection of TWG teas in the room that were replenished each night (not like Mandarin Oriental). Our favourites were the Paris-Singapore and Vanilla Bourbon.
Cons
- Our room rate included a complimentary minibar package ($38). We changed from the standard one to the movies package but unfortunately this didn’t happen. We didn’t feel too put out. The standard mini bar consisted of 3 coconut drinks, a couple of coffee-based drinks, 3 packets of snacks. Not sure how this could total $38.
- Although the rollaway bed wasn’t in the room as indicated at check in, a quick call to House keeping and the bed was in the room within 15 minutes.
- There is no plug for the hair dryer in the bathroom so we had to resort to using the plug by the floor in the walk-in robe – a bit awkward.
The Pros far outweigh the cons and our three nights at the Sofitel was way too short. We truly felt at home there. Great friendly service, lovely new hotel in a prime location.
The down side is, if we return we won't be able to get the Prestige Suite as our son will be over 12 and we'd have to get two rooms : (",Date of stay: December 2019,,5,,,,,,,,Tanjong Pagar,,

It is in a good location on the edge of Chinatown and on top of an MRT station. You can walk to lots of great bars and dining areas. I even caught a bus from just a few blocks away which took me all the way to MacRitchie reservoir without having to change.
The room was quiet and comfortable. The staff were all very good. The pool is terrific - a great size for lap swimming and lovely city skyline views.
I stayed here as part of a package deal which included club access. Some of these executive clubs can be very hit and miss, but this one was worthwhile. The staff were very good, the lounge was very comfortable, and the standard of food and especially the wine served during the evening happy hour is very good.
The main restaurant is okay for breakfast, but there are so many interesting food options nearby that you need not restrict yourself to that.
I would stay here again.",Date of stay: December 2019,,5,,,,,,,,Tanjong Pagar,,

Second day at breakfast, Exec Chef Jean and manager Push arranged a surprise for my son upon knowing it was his birthday. I would like to commend them on their excellent level of service and hospitality. We also went for the Christmas high tea and it was a great relaxing time. The pool was great too!!! My kids had so much fun! The room is luxuriously comfortable and soaking in the bath tub was so relaxing.

I had booked via the Accor-App as I could redeem some points and as we preferred the pictures of the room over the SO Sofitel ones.
When we arrived, we were amazed by the perfect location. From the airport, with one change of metro, it only takes around 30 minutes to the hotel. The hotel itself is located perfectly close to Chinatown, not far away from Raffles Place and the shopping center around offers many nice restaurants as well as local food courts.
We highly enjoyed the breakfast with a lot of varieties of local and Western cuisine, juices etc. The fruit could have tasted a bit better, however this did not spoil our breakfast pleasures.
Bar service is very good, with nicely elaborated drinks. The rooms are very spacious and with high quality amenity kit including shampoo and shower gel from Lanvin.
Only downside was our first room, which was next to the elevator, which was quite noisy during night (which is why I rate this stay Very Good instead of Excellent). However, we mentioned this to the reception and they changed our room without any problem.
We will definitely book Sofitel again for our next stay at Singapore.",Date of stay: December 2019,,4,,,,,,,,Tanjong Pagar,,

It was 10 minutes cab ride from Sentosa, Gardens by the Bay and downtown Singapore. The MTR is right below the hotel but we only used it once since taxis were so easily available and convenient. Two of the most popular hawker centers were 7-10 mins walking distance away so it made eating out very accessible. We stayed in a Prestige suite with a living room and they bought in a roller bed for my older son. The room was phenomenal and spacious. My only complaint is the light inside the bathroom being too dim. We had breakfast included and it was good but after a our third time, we got tired of it. But still really good for no-fuss breakfast. The servers and staff at the restaurant were really friendly and great! We will definitely be back.

The room, and in particular, the bathroom was very nice with its walk in shower. The bed was comfortable, the only thing that was challenging was the control for the AC. Even those who usually like it chilled found it on the extreme but if that’s the problem, we all can live with it!
I had returned to Singapore about 1.5 months later and did consider staying at the Sofitel again but we decided on the Ritz which is located by the bay. While our room at the Ritz had the perfect view, the room and bathroom were not better and completely comparable. The price at the Sofitel was reasonable and my rate included the buffet breakfast which I enjoyed every morning.
At the end of the day, I would highly recommend the Sofitel give the quality of the hotel and despite its location. But the cost of transportation is great in Singapore that I would recommend the Sofitel with its equal amenities to the Ritz but for less price.",Date of stay: September 2019,,5,,,,,,,,Tanjong Pagar,,

Excellent Service!,"We were so impressed with our couple trip at SSCC recently that we decided to bring our kids along this time round (good location to explore cultural side of Singapore). Was initially a bit unsure as young children can be noisy and not all hotels genuinely embrace them especially business hotels. However, I was so impressed on how the staff treated the kids during our check-in. One of the staff explained about the robots to the kids and switch it on ""for a walk"". He was also very patient with all the questions my kids were asking. Another staff offered each child a gift. There were also plenty of smiles around. We were also served with welcome drinks and towel (ontop of the welcome drink voucher). It was a very warm welcome by the staff.

The french restaurant provides a beautiful panaromic view of the city district. We can see the chefs cooking away our dishes and smell the aroma from the open concept kitchen on one side of the restaurant.
We opted for the 98++ which includes free flow Appetisers and Dessert Atelier, unlimited Signature and Premium main courses. We strongly recommend this option for a full blown robust incredible experience. Go big or go home.
The appetiser aisle was right in the middle and had so much to offer; cheese collection, compound salads, cold cuts. There's more than enough to keep you waiting after you have ordered your mains.
The Foie Gras dish was my favourite. Not forgetting the freshly shucked oysters. Lobster bisque has a strong flavor as a kickstarter.
Their angus beef cheek is so tender and juicy. The rock lobster, lamb rack and steak frites were marvellous. The brunch is from 12.30pm to 3.30pm so we had enough time to wash our palate with desserts.
Delectable array of desserts from western to asian to towering chocolate fondue and health-concious sorbets.
We really enjoyed our brunch time at Racines, Sofitel Singapore City Centre. Will definitely tell our friends and come back.
Special mention to Vijaya for being such a pleasant lady and providing to our requests with a heartwarming smile. She deserves a compliment. Kudos to Yusof for being professional and having a lil chat with us.

Staying on level 16 our room was spacious, modern and super clean. With a service you’d expect from a 5 star establishment we enjoyed a nightly turn down service, evening drinks and canapés and a amazing buffet breakfast on level 5. The hotel is right near the MRT and Chinatown. The hotel staff are all super friendly and helpful. The pool area is beautiful and daily access to the Virgin gym is amazing if you like to work out while on vacation. My only criticism (in the spirit of providing feedback) was the TV entertainment. Often on vacation we like to retire before sleep with a movie but we had few channels to choose from. Really only 2 channels. Not a huge deal, we watched something on our iPad but would of been nice if the hotel had cable or something similar like the majority of 5 star hotels.

We arrived and were greeted by Gary who immediately escorted us to Club Millésime for our priority check-in and showed us around our room with all its features and operation. The Club Millésime staff were very accommodating with food and drinks despite arriving late into the evening. The rooms are well appointed as you'd expect from Sofitel. Luxury fittings and amenities and great view overlooking old China town. We also had complimentary Mini Bar, but the selections were uncommon and to be honest, not that appetizing. We dined at Racines and the exceptional service continued throughout the night. The restaurant is a unique split French and Chinese menu that offers each dish according to each cuisine style. We didn't get a chance to have a drink at 1864 bar, but there was a buzz of activity and atmosphere. In the morning Racines transformed into a gourmet buffet breakfast.

The pool area is excellent with a long pool (suitable for laps) and plenty of sun lounges and chairs. There is also 'a lawn' area alongside. The Club has a patio that overlooks the pool area and then also the inside area. The evening drinks and canapés were excellent with some very good hot food options, though they tended to disappear quite quickly. Warning - the peanut butter caramel popcorn is highly addictive! I ate breakfast downstairs in the restaurant and the buffet was exceptionally good with many options I haven't seen in other hotels. I was also happy with the location as it was handy to Chinatown where I went out both nights and all the staff were very efficient and helpful. I was impressed, had no problems whatsoever, and would most certainly stay there again! It was also well priced - I paid only around SIN $250 a night.

We chose the Sofitel City Centre hotel partly because of google rating and reviews. We were not disappointed.
Good location for a weekend visit. Walking distance to Chinatown and a Hawker Center (food stalls) across the road were highlights outside.
Comfortable room and bathroom. Nice decor touch around the hotel with artwork by a local artist. Access to the Millesime Club (extra), nice pool and good gym were inside highlights. Before hand, we were not absolutely sure about buying the Millesime access. Looking in retrospect this was worth every penny.
Food is nothing much at this hotel. Kind of ironic, being a french hotel. Food options are ok by the numbers, but lacking taste and quality. There are serious issues in the organizing around the food. This view is based upon two days of breakfast and afternoon tapas style serving in Club Millesime.
We tried both breakfast options, in the main breakfast in 5th floor restaurant and in the Club Millesime. The available buffet options were ""ok to good"" both places. Serving coffee, eggs etc involved too much wating for being ok.
Lots of staff, so I suppose it´s a organizing-issue. Suggestion: Make the coffee machines available to guests would free up a huge amount of serving capacity... (And while you´re at it: Stop using the Nespresso system creating mountains of waste. There are way better ways of providing guest with good coffee).",Date of stay: November 2019,,4,,,,,,,,Tanjong Pagar,,

Our Club Millesime Room gave us access to the club room which serves excellent coffee, tea and soft drinks throughout the day and alcoholic beverages and a light meal in the evening from 5-7:30 daily. It’s well worth paying the extra as the cocktails, champagne, wine and beer are top quality and the food was delicious. Special thanks to Melody and Maria who looked after us and made us feel welcome. Our spacious room was very comfortable and elegant, with a touch of class. There were nice special touches like a Nespresso machine, exquisite Twining teas, with a fine china tea pot and cups to go with it, and even a wineglass on a rack for the bath with a wellness book to read while you soaked in the tub. Everything was new and spotlessly clean with top class amenities. The hotel decor is very sophisticated with beautiful artwork and the lounge bar and coffee bar seemed always well patronised and had a great vibe. The breakfast buffet at Racines was one of the most extensive I have seen and you’d be guaranteed to breakfast like a king or queen, with all the different choices of local and international foods. It caters for absolutely everyone’s taste and special requirements. We appreciated the many healthy choices on offer and loved the amazing freshly squeezed juices. The coffee is amazing and so is the staff who were all polite, attentive and helpful. All the hotel staff from the concierge, reception, bar attendant and house keeping were polite, professional and ever so helpful. I appreciated getting an email before our arrival enquiring if we had any special needs or requests. It also gave us helpful information on how to get to the hotel from the airport using various forms of transport. The refreshing pool and it surrounds were a great place to refresh after a day of site seeing. The jacuzzi was a wonderful place to relax in. We liked the location of the hotel as it gave us the opportunity to experience a different part of Singapore. We explored the near by streets with their restored historic shophouses, which are now home to numerous businesses, cafes, restaurants and bars.

They prepared a cake and a bottle of wine for the celebration and also some cookies and tea for the rest of us. I was really impressed with the team's support in making the stay comfortable. We also had a cot given for free for a comfortable night rest for my little one. THe children had their fun and got plushies from the hotel too! It made their day and I will say it has been a memorable stay for us. I was hoping to get a little birthday surprise because they made arrangements for it the last round we stayed a year ago but I suppose the bookings were too confusing with so many things happening. All in all it was a great stay and maybe I will consider heading back next year for birthday celebration again!",Date of stay: October 2019,,5,,,,,,,,Tanjong Pagar,,

I was allocated a room (Elevated Kallang) on the 30th floor which promises a really good view of Singapore from where the hotel is situated, regardless of its facing. The room is 51sqm (547sqft) with the view of the Singapore Sports Hub and the Kallang Precinct. The room also has a small walk-in wardrobe area, where I felt revealed the most of its age of the room/property.
A plush King bed that came with two bedside tables, with light and blind switches so that you could turn everything off right from the comfort of the bed. The alarm clock also featured a wireless charging function. The room uses two other mirrors to create an illusion that the room is spacier than what it already is.
The well-stocked pantry completed the living area in the room. It featured drawers of wine and spirits, glasses, varied coffee & tea sachets along with the Nespresso Coffee Machine (with 6 capsules!).
The COVID-19 amenities include masks and hand sanitiser, very thoughtful of the hotel to provide as guests may from time to time miss out on bringing an extra mask.
After taking an evening out for dinner, I returned to the room with the evening turndown service. The bed was made, bedroom slippers were placed nicely next to the bed with a nice white cloth placed below the slippers. Ritz Carlton also provided dark/milk Chocolate bars with a exquisite bookmark at the bedside. I must say, the attention to detail is indeed great. They even demonstrated that the TV could be adjusted towards the bed or the sofa. The TV is a 55-inch IPTV with access to Netflix & YouTube.
Well, the trip to Ritz Carlton ended on a rather sour note. Firstly, during the night, it got a little rowdy as the room allocated to me was right smack in between the passenger lifts and the. Also, the next morning, I stepped on a protruding nail on the floor nearby the window. Thankfully, my reflexes were fast enough to prevent myself from being stabbed right through the nail. Although Ritz Carlton was pretty concerned with my wellbeing, I thought their response was a bit lackadaisical until I requested for more clarity. In short, I was offered a complimentary upgrade with breakfast for 2 during my next stay to the Ritz Carlton, Millenia Singapore. I'm looking forward to my next trip to see if Ritz Carlton, Millenia Singapore will be able to make it up for this near-miss accident.",Date of stay: October 2020,,4,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

It is worth every penny of it!!
We were lucky to have our rooms on the same floor, going to the Club Lounge was just a few steps away. Thus ""pigging out"" was easy, we got to enjoy 5 free culinary meals a day, with free flow beverages of choice, we hang out at the lounge most of the time. The view on the 32nd floor is the best in town, didn't realize the Singapore skyline is so beautiful. The surrounding is wonderful for long walks and walking distance to MBS, Gardens by the Bay & financial district.
My sister had very specific dietary requirements, the chefs (Benton & Benson) went out of their way to satisfy her requests and came out to meet us. The assistant mgr. Chuck's service was outstanding and personable, he would go out of his way to fulfill our requests. Special thank to Marble Hoe, she overheard my casual mentioned about being there for my birthday and she surprised me with a healthy watermelon cake, her service level is so attentive & exceptional. Tina was the other staff who also treated us like VIPs, satisfying our special requests.

The overall dining experience with Ritz surpasses my expectations as a 5 star rating property . This experience has made me come forward to express my thoughts and appreciation to the F&B operation team.
First of all , Food was up to expectations. Of cos it is ! Ambience was nice and cosy Last but not least , The standard of service delivered by the F&B team during the dinner buffet service was ""WOW"". I can only describe my experience as superb and exceptional.A dining steward/waiter was attached to my table and his name is Beng Kuan ( Sorry if i have gotten his name wrongly as i briefly took a peek at his name tag ) He is definitely a good addition to the team back at Ritz Carlton . He is proactive , attitude is friendly , attentive and uses good verbiage to me as a dining guest. Not forgetting the few ladies working with him as well within the section I am dining at.

A few things to take note, check in is now at level 1(or the basement) usually it is at level 3 or should i consider it the first floor coz thats where you the main lobby is if you come by car/taxi. Renovations are ongoing but not a big problem.
Room with the Singapore skyline is absoulutely breathtaking. A nice thing to do is have a relaxing time in the bathtub at night while enjoying the view! The bathtub is amazing!!! They gave me some nice treats for my birthday and a card. A very nice touch!

The location is great - it lets you explore Singapore wonderfully by foot. The first evening we did a full circle of the bayfront area . We set off for the Jubilee walking trail another day. We went exploring Arab Street another day. The location is a foodie’s paradise too. We started with the Saturday lunch buffet at Ritz itself at their restaurant The Colony. Great food, service and pricing. We will be returning again to the restaurant. Other days we visited the Marina Bay Sands mall to check out the variety available there , Arab Street for Mediterranean food . The Ritz Carlton brand stands for quality and service and we were not disappointed by the pro-active service of the staff there - beginning with Raphael at the reception; Regina , Lee Lee, Firdaus at The Colony; Viraj Rao, Gerald at the concierge.",Date of stay: September 2020,,5,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

We booked the safari package and the kids were delighted with the treats and tent setup in the room. We would also like to commend Eve at the poolside. She was really conscientious in wiping down the deck chairs and offered to take pictures for our family. She was also really good with the kids and they loved interacting with her.
Breakfast was done really well and the food were fresh and delicious. The only disappointment was that they didn't offer any Asian options. Since there are many locals on staycation currently, I would urge the hotel to have a western and Asian option for the guests. Overall, I would love to return for another staycation soon.",Date of stay: September 2020,,5,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

I had initially booked the Deluxe Marina Bay view room with the Club Lounge access. However, close to my check-in date, I realized they upgraded me to the Millenia Suite. That was a pleasant surprise but I know I still have got to see how the service would be like. Check-in was seamless - I had Naoki assisting me and even wished me an advance Happy Birthday. When I got to my room, I realized they had set it up with a note from the ladies & gentlemen of the Ritz Carlton Club, coupled with a plate of fruits and a box of chocolates. I note they had also remembered my preferences (from the last stay in August) i.e. more bottled water and an ice bucket to always be there. Upon check-in, I also received a call from Tina from the Club Lounge, to check if everything was okay with the Suite. This feels personal and I love it. I went up to the Club Lounge (level 32) and boy, everything that was served there was excellent. They provide 5 meals presentations daily (breakfast, light snack, afternoon tea, evening cocktail and desserts). I attended everything except breakfast (not a morning person) and desserts (I had chocolates in my room). Their staffs are all friendly and I felt welcomed throughout my entire visit. On the actual day of my birthday, Razak from Club Lounge gave me a call at the Suite because his colleague had a delivery for me but my suite was put on Do Not Disturb. I opened the door only to see the Club Lounge team carrying a birthday cake and singing a Happy Birthday song! That was such a pleasant surprise and an extremely sweet gesture. I had my parents for afternoon tea on Sunday and they took great care of our afternoon tea. Everything was served to perfection. The suite was huge and gorgeous and the view is to die for. Spending time at the bathtub with such a view is something which needs to be done - no questions asked. I was also granted late check-out (3pm) and I had my afternoon tea and finally left the property at 5.15pm. To the team at Ritz Carlton: Naoki (check-in), Eva (poolside), Sheila, Tina, Chuck, Razak, Firdaus and Michelle (Club Lounge) - Thank you for the impeccable service throughout my entire stay, for ensuring my needs are well taken care of and for simply making me feel welcomed. I will be back in December to see everyone again!",Date of stay: September 2020,,5,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

"The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore",Yvonne,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/berryvonne,,Yvonne wrote a review Sep 2020,11 contributions,Poor Memory To Last A Lifetime,"I thought to just share with everyone an extremely unpleasant incident which happened at the end of my 2D1N stay at the suite with my family. As I am pregnant in my third trimester, we only brought our 2 year old daughter on the last day afternoon.
We went to the club lounge upon a late check out with the Amex charge card entitlement. We went to the lounge only with the intention of getting some drinks and for our child to see how it looked like. We also brought our helper along and told Ewan once we arrived about it.
Ewan invited my helper to also order a drink despite us voicing my reservations to him about the fact that she was not actually included in the stay. But Ewan, being the hospitable man that he is insisted on giving my helper a glass of pineapple juice. And true to the initial hospitality that was displayed by your team, Navin even invited us to stay for dinner as 1730 was approaching. It was with that in mind that I decided to stay since my family and I were having such a good time. It was upon this premise that my husband asked for dinner because the staff has mentioned that we could stay for dinner.
However, Mabel had to completely ruin my experience by dropping by once she heard about this - when my husband placed my order for 2 dinner sets to tell him that actually we were not entitled to stay upon checkout and that my helper had to pay a fee of $65. I am sure there are better ways of communicating this and she should have checked with her own staff before rashly approaching us and making us look really embarrassed, with no dignity. I have contacted the hotel upon check out to ask for this amount to be charged to our card since we are made to feel really insulted when the context was that we did not ask for anything but your staff offered us these benefits.
To add the injury to the insult, we were given the dinner (2 chicken dish and 1 mutton dish) as if we really wanted to be parasites. The whole dinner course actually included other items like soup etc.
In the first place, when we first reached the lounge, we have kindly announced and alerted Ewan that our helper is there and she does not require any drink because we did not pay for her share. Her role was to take care of our child as I was heavily pregnant. However, the team still allowed and gave our helper a pineapple juice drink which was a nice gesture.
As I was aware that my husband felt really upset after the conversation with Mabel, I then walked to the main desk to inform Tina that we do not require any dinner and will leave. However, it was too late as dinner was already served and my child was happily eating the chicken. My husband did not eat the dinner served as I shared with Mabel and Navin when we left.
I also want to mention that in the morning at breakfast, my husband also alerted Mabel that the whole morning from 2-6am, there was a PA announcement which made me unable to sleep the whole night. Of course, her response was that no other customer has given that feedback. Upon investigating, there was an incident of fire at the float but in any case, it was stated to us that it was not the hotel’s fault which we understand but we are also affected by it nevertheless. We felt that at the first instance, our experience was not acknowledged. We were nice about it but after the poor lounge experience, we felt really upset that the stay overall has been mediocre.
In the suite, the bidet in the toilet was not working. Upon check out, the hotel also wanted to bill us for the laundry we sent which was supposedly part of the entitlement so my husband has highlighted to the staff that it should not be billed.
To be fair, the service provided by some of the staff such as Navin, Ewan and Sheila has been good. We also experienced good service at Summer Pavilion by Sangrine (pardon me for the wrong spelling). Sheila also took efforts for service recovery but it does appear that it is insufficient at this stage. It has been a disappointing stay in Ritz and a poor memory to last a lifetime. As compared to our stays at Shangri La Valley Wing, Capella and Fullerton, this suite stay has been the most expensive and we feel really disheartened by this stay. Our first and last stay, perhaps?",Date of stay: September 2020,,1,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

On my reservation, it was noted that I am expecting a baby, but what I did not expect was a non-alcoholic bottle of sparkling grape juice waiting for us in the room, and all the Nespresso capsules changed to decaf (even the Nescafe sachets were decaf). <3 There was delicious cake too, and a card to congratulate us on our wedding anniversary.
I'd like to thank the Ladies and Gentlemen of the Ritz-Carlton Millenia, for always going the extra mile with kind gestures beyond our imagination. I'm sorry I did not get many of your names, being overwhelmed as usual by your excellent hospitality. We are so fortunate to be able to stay there, and even without the extras, this hotel will always be our top choice for a staycation. Being pregnant during Covid-19 times means I always have to take extra precautions, but I had utmost confidence in the hotel and felt completely safe throughout my stay.
I haven't had a good cup of coffee in a long while, and the Nespresso decaf ristretto was great. Being pregnant during Covid-19 also means I have very limited exercise options, so the late check-out allowed me to squeeze in another swim the next day. These things meant so much to me during my stay. My husband and I deeply appreciate everything the hotel has done for us.

If there were more than 5 circles in the Tripadvisor ratings, I would have absolutely given it to Ritz Carlton!!
I stayed one night on 5 Sep at Ritz. I had booked initially for 1 club deluxe marina room for purpose of proposal. To my most pleasant surprise, I was upgraded straight to 1 BR millenia suite at level 27 without even being asked! The view from the room was just speechless!The upgrade was way too awesome! Thank you Ritz! You made my proposal so much better and delighted my partner!
Next the club lounge food was absolutely amazing. The spread was great, and there was really no need to even step out of Ritz to buy any more food. It was essentially non stop eating from morning till night! The selection of drinks was just wonderful! Yummy food and awesome drinks! What a delightful combination! The view from level 32 was priceless too!
Last but not least, the human touch and superb service was just a class above the rest! I was too shocked that the club lounge personnel even remembered my name before I stepped into the hotel! Everyone were so pleasant and beautiful with smiles to their faces and they were so warm! The stay was just so much better with these people around!

The hotel truly lives up to its name as a luxury 5 star hotel. The room’s luxurious interior made us fell in love with its every detail. The bathroom was the highlight of our stay! The signature hexagon bay window complimented the bathtub which brightens the bathroom creating a romantic ambience. As it was our special day, the hotel presented us with a cake & some macarons along with a personalised message card.
From breakfast to dessert hour, our tummies were delighted with good spread of food. For us, this is the only hotel we’ve been that served 5 daily culinary presentation. In short, we were well fed.

Ritz Carlton continues to exhibit the same level of professionalism and service despite the rates being significantly cheaper than usual (the Singapore government has bought up a large share of these rooms for returnees to Singapore).
I want to thank Arul and Riri for their excellent support.
I had a problem with the room phone and they tried their best to address the issue despite not being able to come into the room.
As they couldn't fix the problem, they offered to move me but I didn't want the trouble.
As a gesture of goodwill their Senior AV officer, Muhammad Naim, gave me a complimentary yoga mat. This is such a nice surprise. Upon checking in I had requested for one but they weren't able to fulfil the request, for what I am sure are very good reasons seeing I am a potential Covid patient. So to get a mat is really a pleasant surprise.
The hotel is also giving me complimentary hard copies of the Financial Times for the 14 days I am in quarantine. The Ritz Carlton Singapore is definitely making my 14 days ""imprisonment"" as pleasant as possible.
BTW, ""prison grub"" is not too bad so far except for breakfast, which is a disappointment.

Along with the usual selection of scones, cakes, cucumber sandwiches, there were chicken tandoori pita, ondeh ondeh and many other tasty and beautifully presented bites.
Scone was properly buttery and milky. Wish there was more of it. Really appreciate that they use clotted cream instead of whipped cream (like some other high teas). Particularly enjoyed the Strawberry Coconut Choux Puff - that thin (but bursting with flavour) sheet of strawberry on the puff... can Colony please put that into a cake, a mousse cup or something? We need more of it!
Selection of teas was fun with choices including lychee oolong, mandarin orange, oriental beauty (with notes of wild honey, wood and rose petals).

We were the first guests after the Covid lockdown and wow did they look after us!
It was also my 50th birthday and they really made sure that it was a truly outstanding and memorable event. Incredible personal service from Sheila, Mabel and the entire team.
We were upgraded to the 32nd floor Premier Suite and had the club lounge and pool to ourselves which was superb. The Club Lounge is worth paying extra for with the 5 meals a day and non-stop champagne served at the lounge, always with a smile and they always can't do enough for you.
On my birthday itself they arrange a special birthday menu of activities for the entire day and presented it beautifully. It was overwhelming!
They decorated my room with birthday greetings and even decorated the spa when I went there for a massage!
It seemed like everyone in the hotel knew it was my birthday - just amazing service and amazing feeling. The warmth and consideration was simply unprecedented and incredible.

We'd planned another staycation. Unfortunately that's not going to happen now. But the afternoon tea set, so carefully prepared, brought back wonderful memories of our time at Ritz- Carlton. Thanks RC!

So we chose the perfect moment, our honeymoon, to experience a stay here.
We love to go on staycations as we work in hospitality industry.
We also enjoy the benefits, as we work at the company, but this is truly our own personal opinions and feelings!
We were wowed as soon as we step foot there.
It’s true what my friends, colleagues been saying. The service was flawless.
Very curious to how they managed it behind the scene.
We know certainly one lady, Murphy Loh, Guest Relations Manager was the one who planned extra surprises for us in the room. Thank you Murphy and team for arranging all of those delights!
Room was immaculate. On top of that, we also got a creative towel arrangement. Excellent housekeeping team!
Very glad to meet Adam Theo, Assistant Chef Concierge. We were so impressed by him. An example of someone who does what’s he’s passionate about.
Our schedules were packed, but we thought we must at least go for breakfast at Colony.
It was superb! Still regret that we couldn’t go dinner nor lunch there. I wrote a separate review at the Colony page.
Also just moments before we checked out we wanted to take a stroll around Gardens by the Bay and we asked one of the supervisors for direction. While he was leading us, with all of us just outside the lobby, Kumar, Bellman, was secretly paying attention and suddenly handed us a cute little map. Those small meaningful touches that made it wow.
We felt very recognized and important
Truly a honeymoon trip we won’t ever forget.
Felt terrible that we didn’t get everyone’s name. So sorry, but we greatly appreciate all the ladies and gentlemen of The Ritz-Carlton Millenia.
Will be back with our bigger family!
Please take care during this tough time.

The hotel is conveniently located and linked by a walkway to Millenia Walk, which also has an MRT stop, and another shopping centre (Marina Square). I stayed here for a transit in early March, when the effects of COVID-19 were already felt in Singapore and it was less busy than usual.
The room is generously sized but rather plain and old-fashioned, with two prominent features which are the wall-to-wall panoramic window (it's a great view from a high floor, whether towards Marina Bay or Kallang district), and the octagonal window from the bathroom. As for the facilities, there is a spacious gym, an attractive though shallow pool, and blissful jacuzzi & sauna in the change room.
But what impressed me most during my stay (and the reason to come back here) is the exceptional standard of service. The staff are hospitable and always ready to attend to your needs with a smile. On the check-out day, when my afternoon flight was delayed into the evening, they very kindly allowed a late check-out and I could also still use the facilities.

Hence, we pick a kid's staycation package with Ritz Carlton. The idea of having a tent in the room make me skeptical initially never thought my 4-year-old daughter actually enjoyed so much. I was also never expected the room is big enough to have a tent inside yet still have ample space for us to walk around and my daughter to run around. The next area is the toilet, where there is ample space as well for a big bathtub.
At this point in time, staff morale could below where a lot of jobs could be uncertain. However, the staff there did not put on a long face while working among themselves, instead still very ready to serve the guest. Especially, the staffs did give attention to a 4-year-old toddler whenever she talks abt something and asks for something, it is very thoughtful.
After breakfast, we went to the pool. The staff brought a towel for us and also a float along. My daughter jumps to joy and had a wonderful time in the swimming pool with the additional stuff they provided.
We had our weekend dinner buffet and breakfast at the Colony. The dinner spread wasn't a lot but is really good enough for us to enjoy. The best dishes are the grilled lobsters. Breakfast was also good too, they had an Ala cart buffet.

The main outstanding feature of the Ritz Carlton Millenia is their consistently impeccable service throughout the whole hotel.
The club staff create a personalised experience, that makes the difference of getting to know the guests.

Instead, we were welcomed and offered not only an early check-in, but a complimentary upgrade to a suite, which was a great treat. We were checked in by Fabio, who took the time to find out what we hoped to see & do in Singapore and then gave us some insider tips, including writing out a list of local foods he thought we'd enjoy (his best tip: download the Grab app, which is like a version of Uber - efficient, reliable and much cheaper than taxis). The room was really spacious and well-appointed with everything we needed. The views in both directions were breathtaking - the bedroom and lounge overlooked the marina whilst the bathroom overlooked the Singapore Flyer & the bay. The service by every single staff member we encountered was fantastic - they were all cheerful, professional and willing to go the extra mile to keep us happy. During our 3-night stay there, the New Zealand & Australian governments imposed new travel restrictions due to Covid-19, resulting in us having to urgently cancel the rest of our planned holiday and arrange flights back home to South Africa. The duty manager, Jithra (Jit), was an absolute star, making calls to some of the Australian hotels on our behalf and helping wherever she could, as well as waiving the cost of the necessary international phone calls, which alleviated a lot of the stress. The location is perfect, being within comfortable walking distance of the Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay Sands, Merlion Park and the Marina Espanade. There are also restaurants and a decent food court (Makansutra Gluttons Bay) in the vicinity.

I'd lunch at the Summer Pavilion and it was amazing! The restaurant was full and the food was fantastic! truly living up to the Michelin standard!
Breakfast at Colony was a little too quiet due to the low occupancy but it was good as there was no need to queue at the egg station! Breakfast spread was sumptuous despite the low occupancy. Egg benedict was superb. Breakfast at Colony made my my day! 😀
Staff were extremely helpful and friendly.
1. The Guest Relations lady who processed our checked-in in the room was very friendly and pleasant. Grooming was immaculate! (I was too overwhelmed by all the activity on-going in the room at point of check-in that i did not manage to take down her name. )

Booked a room for the kallang view. I have to say i love the view, even though there is like a expressway but morning sunrise view was breath taking, i couldn't ask for more. We stayed at the 29th floor and the room was beautiful and spacious. The kids and i personally LOVE the bathroom with a view, it's AMAZING! The in room service was wonderful, the staff were very friendly and helpful. The food was nice, my kids loved it. The staffs are so patient and really put in alot of effort to make our stay comfortable as much as possible. I can never praise them enough. When asked for a feedback regarding our stay, I told them that it would be lovely if the room is provided with a bidet. Only thinking it was meant to be future purposes that they could implement, I got a ultimate surprise when they informed us that they were able to install a bidet for our room. I was speechless. No other hotels that we've stayed in would provide us over the top service. It was crazy, but in a good way. The buffet breakfast was quite a spread, i love the wide cheese variety and despite the fact they do not serve halal food, there were different alternatives for me to eat and the staff there were patient enough to go through with me the items that contains alcohol or pork/lard. My family and i definitely enjoyed our short break and i would DEFINITELY come back in the future to stay with them again. It was such a lovely experience and the staffs deserves the respect that i have for them to be so accommodating and helpful towards their guests.",Date of stay: March 2020,,5,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

We thoroughly enjoyed the soups, which must have required so much skill and effort to prepare, as it was so full-bodied and did not taste like much/any seasoning had to be added at all. The London duck was so aromatic and moist, it's probably the best thing I'm going to have tasted in 2020. I usually scrape all the fats off duck skin, but I ate every bit of this duck, including the fats and it wasn't greasy at all.
Service, as always, was impeccable. Every visit to Ritz Carlton is like returning home - the service is warm and approachable without being intrusive. Siew Kee, the server assigned to our table, has excellent people skills. She made sure we were our needs were met with her attentive service, while making small talk so we felt relaxed. The thing about the Ritz Carlton service is that they always think of the things we don't - they served the elders at the table first and I felt that was extremely thoughtful.

Specially enjoyed the deep fried beancurd with spicy salt, drunken prawns and hor fun - dishes common in Chinese restaurants but done so much better here. The skin of the beancurd was crispy and umami-ish (addictive!). The prawns were needless to say, super fresh, and very good without the need for any sauce. Table side service for the prawns was interesting as we watched the cook Siat Yin deftly flambé the prawns. The hor fun had so much wok hei that my mum and I would be happy to just have kway teow on its own.
Would like to thank our server Siew Kee, for her very attentive and cheerful service. We felt so at ease with her that she felt more like a friend.

Every member of the Ritz Carlton were incredible and nothing was too much for them.
We stayed in the room overlooking Marina Bay Sands, and whilst pricey it is worth every cent. The room is huge and so very beautiful. As this was to celebrate our anniversary and my partner’s birthday they even arranged a fruit platter and a cake made out of towels, so sweet!

We stayed in room 1310 and it was fantastic, the views of the bay were breathtaking. The house keeping team of Eric, LiLi, Han, Ian and Analyn were amazing! They made you feel like we were the only guests in the Hotel, truly remarkable experience.
They found out that we were to be married in June and when we arrived back at our room that evening, (our crew as I affectionately referred to them) decorated the bathtub with rose petals and two wonderful Swans made from bath towels.
When we would have breakfast at their restaurant, The Colony, we were always so pleasantly greeted. We have to also thank the Colony Services Team of Deepak, Elenna and our favorite Lee Lee (she was amazing). They were all so kind and gracious.

However, I had not been for a couple of years and was slightly disappointed by my latest trip.
The welcome at reception was excellent as ever. Aira made sure that I had a quiet room and also arranged a late check-out for me.
The rooms are large, elegant and everything works well - with a comfortable bed, good lighting, excellent wifi and connectivity as well as great views over the city.
The best thing about the Ritz-Carlton is the bathroom. The panoramic window over the bath is iconic and the asprey amenities were luxurious.
On my first morning I needed to have an early breakfast with room service. I opted for the healthy breakfast with egg white omelette and mushrooms, which was very good, Bircher muesli and strawberry shake which were also very nice.
One highlight of my previous visits to the Ritz Carlton had been the pool and the gym facilities.
The gym facilities had been given a make-over. While the Hotel were clearly very proud of their new gym set up, it really did not work as well for me! For a start, there were no signs poiting to the chaging areas and I could not find the lockers without having to find someone and ask. While the gym area itself had more cardio machines, with a separate stretch area and free weights area at one end of main gym, it felt much less bright and welcoming than the previous arrangement. Finally, the shower was too complex to get to work properly!
While the pool remains great - as ever. Eva, the friendly pool attendant, making me feel welcome and making time to welcome the families enjoying their time with their children. It was clearly a family friendly environment even as a business hotel.
While the dinner buffet was very complete with choices from sushi, salad, pasta and main meals, alongside a wide range of desserts and French cheeses, the breakfast buffet the following morning was very disappointing.
There seemed to be no clear organization of different elements with, just as a small example, Muesli and Bircher Muesli in vastly different locations and no 'extras' like nuts or seeds or raisins visible even when asked about.
Maybe I was unlucky, but when I went to get some bacon and scrambled eggs they had run out...the a la carte 'egg station' had just two people preparing the eggs with a long queue. Elsewhere there was someone cooking poached eggs - but these were for eggs benedict and he was making each a work of art, so took an age to do that. QUite simply, if you were in a hurry at the start of a busy business day there was not enough capacity
The fresh fruit was very limited...with no berries (potted raspberries were over with the cereals), no pineapple, no mango, just melon and papaya and water melon...whole apples, no bananas. Quite honestly, it was pretty hopeless for a luxury hotel.
Finally, the tea was pourred from hot pots of water...not made with freshly boiling water resulting in a tepid and thin beverage.
In summary, the staff were great, the rooms superb, but the catering and gym were disappointing enough to make me think that on my next visit I would try a different hotel.",Date of stay: September 2019,,4,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

To enjoy it’s excellent location, book a room from the Marina side and you won’t be disappointed. The views are to die for. The rooms are spacious and I really love the minimalist decor, with a touch of classic luxury. The design reminds me of Japanese or Finnish minimalist design.
When booking a Club room, you get to enjoy all typical Lounge benefits. However, Ritz Carlton has taken their lounge game to another level. They do the usual five servings, as you would expect, but after the closing time, guest can use the lounge kitchen area and bring food and drinks to their rooms. But be warned, you don’t really want to leave the hotel and there’s really no reason for that anyway.
The pool area is superb with a lap pool and there’s usually plenty of space . Pool restaurant serves awesome dishes and there’s a sitting area, if you don’t want to eat on your lounger. Lorenzo from the pool was the star of the show, with a great attitude. Some of the other staff were not really doing that much and no smiles were given.
When I arrived to the hotel, I was greeted by Anastasia. She offered to do a quick tour of the hotel but I decided to go straight to the Club lounge. She took me there and check in was really fast.

I can say this and again that you should book RCS to exeperience their services and although there may be times when service seems not just right for others, I would like to emphasize that it is really their service attitude that sets RCS apart from any 6 star hotel in Singapore.
They are aware I am deaf so they actually plan how we can communicate, made sure I understand what is going on and took care of me like a happy guest. I loved how the 2 ladies went beyond their calls to help me decor the room selflessly even when I don't request for that.

January 13th - 17th
We have stayed here before and we do love this hotel. We arrived from Bali from the Ritz-Carlton Reserve (see review).
Check in is swift and carried out on the Club Lounge level. Tina was so helpful and informative.
We had a corner suite which was beautiful. The interior is sleek and exquisite. The views from our room were incredible we could see the harbour, and the Singapore flyer, we could watch the Spectra light and water show from the comfort of our room. The views are spectacular especially from the bath tub!
We had access to the Club Lounge, which as from previous experience we really enjoyed. The breakfast (and snacks) in the club lounge have a fabulous view of Singapore. The staff members at Ritz-Carlton Millenia are so polite, friendly, professional and hard working (although they make everything look effortless). Always smiling and greeting guests.
The decor / interior design and architectural design is breathtaking! The works of art are truly stunning, Cornucopia by Frank Stella greets you in the Lobby! You must see them.
The food is wonderful and my favourite is the Afternoon Tea accompanied by the wonderful pianist. They have a Michelin-starred Summer Pavilion.
Ritz-Carlton is my favourite hotel group for their comfortable beds and pillows, so much so that I will be ordering some pillows soon.
The hotel is a short walk to the shopping Mall - Shoppes at Marina which is convenient and full of my favourite shops!
The room service is fabulous we had a night in and it was delicious, hot and the server was so friendly and helpful in setting up our dinner.
The hotel has plenty of options for dining, art and spa and amenities.
For a large hotel, you are still made to feel very welcome and valued.

We were met by a lovely gentleman out the front of the hotel who took us up to the Club Lounge and settled us in. I’m so disappointed I can’t remember his name. Unlike us, he remembered our names and had a chat each time we arrived and left the hotel- very impressive.
We were checked in early and given a room on the same level as the Club Lounge. I was concerned that the room might have been a bit noisy as it was directly opposite the lounge. I am a very light sleeper! I asked if it was possible to be moved to a quieter area of the hotel. We were allocated a beautiful room one floor down later that afternoon. It was very quiet, no noise from neighbours or plumbing from other rooms.
Bed are very comfortable and linen of a high quality. The bathroom was very spacious and had beautiful toiletries. The bath is incredibly comfortable....I had 3 baths during our 2 night stay. Pure bliss. The bathrobes are out of this world!! The most comfortable robe I have encountered - I just had to purchase one to take home.
The Club Lounge is a wonderful place to escape to. Staff are friendly and extremely efficient. Food is amazing!! The cocktail list is very impressive and there is a chef available to ask about allergens...extremely helpful if you need it. We decided to eat breakfast at Colony - spectacular!! There are so many dishes to choose from. Every single dish was cooked to perfection.
Pool area is huge. A great place to escape the heat for awhile.
Location of the hotel is fantastic. It’s a short walk to so many of Singapore’s attractions, Gardens by the Bay, Merlion, shopping complex at Marina Bay Sands and the whole marina area.
The hotel is expensive- we saved for a long time to stay here. Was it worth it? Every dollar. We have made life long memories at this hotel.",Date of stay: April 2019,,5,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

The breakfast buffet may be the best I've ever seen, though I didn't sample the restaurants for other meals. My room was delightful - I could have spent hours gazing out the window at the city. My only complaint was the staff at the front desk who didn't seem able to answer my questions or solve the minor problems I had. Perhaps they were a bit inexperienced and just overwhelmed by the activity of the race week-end, but things didn't get done quickly enough, and some of the requests I made took hours to be honoured.

The hotel is stunning and very clean. We enjoyed the breakfast room very much. As Europeans we found it somehow extraordinary. It is not only the design and the presentation of the buffets, but the food was delicious - outstanding.
I was looking forward to this stay and I convinced my wife to book this particular property. Being a hotelier myself I was looking for nothing more than extraordinary to experience.
But what really mattered and wowed us was the kindness and the genuine care the Ladies and Gentlemen displayed every day from the Front Office and Concierge to Spa and Accommodation. The chefs in the morning were very welcoming, always smiling and ready to accommodate your every need.
Whereas the start was not what I was hoping for, the remainder of the stay was excellent.
My 6 year old son quickly developed a bond with the hotel staff and did not want to leave, which I found it quite impressive. Every day there were amenities left for him to enjoy and on the last night we as well received a bottle of champagne.
There are no words to express my gratitude to Archie for looking after us, to Roti for playing with my son while at the pool (and one more gent which I am embarrassed to say I could not retain his name), and to Adam, the Concierge for his wonderful recommendations offered throughout our time there.
Thank you,

My loyalty to the RC brand was not appreciated. First, different staff gave me different responses. An example would be one staff member would say Halal food is unavailable in the resort while another staff says that Halal food is available at the property. After a long day at work I think I deserve a Halal meal in my room when I stay at a luxury hotel rather than having to go outside myself to find a Halal dish. Is this howl you treat your loyal guests?
Every night I had issues with my TV (sometimes when I watch a movie the TV loses its signal, the vision gets blurry and my movie experience gets ruined after a long day on my business trip.) On one occasion I came back after a long day only to have the light bulb reach the end of its life in my bathroom (no issues with that.) The funny part is that when the bulb expired there was burning smell in my room which stayed there for 2 - 3 hours, causing me further inconveniences.
As a loyal RC client I demanded to speak to the General Manager for the inconvenience caused, but apparently I was not important enough to be given attention to, despite that I was willing to stay 10 - 11 nights here. Not even $1 was deducted from the bill.
My loyalty to the RC ends here and I would never recommend any one to stay in this hotel. It's funny that I moved to a different hotel (not a luxury brand hotel) and had a much better experience there!
I do not recommend any one to stay here. You are paying only for the brand name! Service is non-existent!",Date of stay: June 2019,,1,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

Unfortunately, it turned out to be a very disappointing experience.
Because we were in Singapore during New Year’s we had the impression that the hotel was like a low category Disney resort during high season, from lines to get elevators to breakfast placed on a ballroom on 1st January it all felt like group traveling. Breakfast was like attending a very busy business conference - everything that we did not want during a family holiday. There were lots of coaches from JTB (Japanese tour operator) dropping and picking up guests at the hotel.
We tried to upgrade to the club, but even the club was fully booked, so we had to remain with the group style stay...
The worse happened this afternoon, when we wanted to have a cake and a coffee. They were serving a snack buffet (quite pricey) but were able to seat us aside for a la carte coffee. The minute my husband started eating his cake, a waiter came, interrupted him and asked him to sign the bill while he was eating. Unbelievable!! I was going to ask for another coffee, but gave up and we went upstairs.
I think Ritz Carlton is no longer what it used to be. The room is comfortable, but already tired. We were on the 32nd floor and could see that carpets are tired, need some lift up. One thing that is annoying for this level of pricy hotel is to have a hair dryer that is fixed on the wall. The lighting of the room is also tricky.
Singapore has better options for this price level. We have friends staying at Raffles and it seemed much more adequate then Ritz Carlton.",Date of stay: January 2020,,2,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

The spa contains a working sauna steam room and two Jacuzzi pools that A company soothing music along with water stations and a lounge with massage chairs where you can put your feet up or lie down and take a lovely nap.

Additional Info: This hotel does not participate in the Marriott Bonvoy program. So, as a Titanium member I did not get any benefits or points. I was not aware of this until I checked into the hotel. The Marriott website does not mention this at the time of booking. That is the only downside to staying here.",Date of stay: December 2019,,5,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

Everything at the property was of a 5 star standard and the cherry on the cake was the impeccable service. From the moment we arrived we were greeted personally and shown to the check in desk where Evan was kind enough to upgrade our Marina view room to a double aspect suite which had a beautiful view of the Marina as well as an incredible view of the Singapore flyer from the bathroom. The amenities in the room were excellent and we were very pleased to be treated to a little honeymoon gift every day of our stay ranging from cakes to a retro sweets selection!
The hotel lobby was a beautiful place to relax and boasted a very pretty bakery where we often bought some sweet treats in the afternoon. The hotel had an excellent location and what must be one of the best views in the city. From the room you could see Marina Bay sands, Gardens by the bay, the opera house and the museum of science. At 8pm and 9.30pm every night there was the Marina bay sands light show which was worth staying in to watch!
One evening we stayed in and ordered room service and I was delighted to see that the in room dining service was of the same quality as everything else we’d seen at the property. Both the food and the dining set up were excellent with a good sized dining table and real silverware.

Previous stays have been with the Mandarin Oriental, but our last 2018 stay was here. That stay was exceptionally poor. This time was a much happier memory. They even remembered that it was our 25 year wedding anniversary last year and congratulated us for year 26 this time around.
We absolutely adored Andrew & Satha our room attendants who took care of things beyond our expectations. In fact, the second night, we found they realized my husband wouldn't fit the standard hotel slippers and located a very large pair which they positioned next to his very large shoes in order to demonstrate a size match. Not only was this touching, but it was thinking outside the box and we had not asked them to do this...they just did it on their own. That is service beyond expectation and it's also pretty cute :-).
Additionally Nadki Sakamoto who provided our check in was super helpful and made us very comfortable while we waited for our room to be ready. He offered a comfortable chair and beverage of our choice while we waited. I enjoyed a Singapore Sling while my husband sampled a tea.
Once we were able to enter our accommodations, we were delighted to find a lovely suite as an extended apology for the 2018 Ritz-Carlton Millenia Singapore stay. Their very capable Muhammad Zarid Bin Abdul Rashid must have arranged this because following the 2018 stay it was his apologies and initiative that convinced us to once again ""try"" the Ritz-Carlton Millenia Singapore. Had it not been for him, we would never have returned.
The staff has done an excellent job or turning things around and we will suggest this hotel to friends and colleagues alike.",Date of stay: December 2019,,5,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

The hotel has the luxurious feel you’d expect from a Ritz Carlton, and for us, the price was reasonable. The room was large, with a huge bathroom and both rooms had stunning views of the Singapore skyline. I did not use the spa. There are several restaurants inside the hotel. We only ate there twice, since there are so many places in this great food city. The main reason we’d return is the staff who are genuinely friendly, helpful, and upbeat. In particular we liked Michelle at the bar, who was talented as well as being sweet. But all the staff we encountered made us feel special.",Date of stay: December 2019,,5,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

A staff member (Sarahfina) met me at the door, was expecting me, and took me directly to my room and gave me a short tour since the room had a lot of features (primarily how to close the blinds for the really large windows). Everything was exceptionally clean, and whenever I needed anything (later or earlier room make-up time, refreshments at the pool, help with a key) everyone was eager to help. The breakfast buffet was huge, with food from American and European style breakfasts as well as several Asian cuisines. You could eat enough to keep you going for a full day (but don't, because there's a lot of great food to be eaten in Singapore). The pool was big enough (25m) to swim laps but fancy enough to see a few social media photo shoots. Alvin (one of the pool attendants) was always there to offer help. The gym was extremely well equipped, with separate areas for yoga/stretching and cardio machines.

Deepak, Phil, Liz, and Elena also we’re so attentive, welcoming, and warm and brought me treats and made my stay great!
Chefs Daric, Han, and Kelly prepared special dishes for me to try, which were so delicious and beautifully put together! The shrimp dish chef Daric prepared was SO delicious and I loved the fun shaped pancakes Chef Han made for me. Chef Kelly made a beautiful plate of dim sum for me that was very delicious!
I’d also love to thank Shui ying from housekeeping who is so kind when prepared beautiful bubble baths in my my room with flowers, bath soaps, and towel sculptures. What an amazing way to end the day!

We stayed in a One bedroom Millenia Suite.
Our room was beautiful with sweeping views of Marina Bay. The rooms was spacious, clean and elegantly decorated. The decor and room is showing it’s age and could use a refresh.
Service was good. We arranged a limo pickup and that went smoothly and they allowed us to skip the front desk line and check-in in our suite. The club lounge is a must in my opinion. Tons of value here. Delicious food and free flowing wine, champagne and cocktails. Room service was also excellent. I highly recommend the Laksa.
The spa was good but not great. The massages we had were satisfactory but we felt a bit rushed through our treatment. And it seemed like there was a lot of confusion at the spa reception desk. Lots of people standing around and many customers were getting frustrated. The spa itself is pretty small but it houses all the amenities you would expect from a high end spa.
Gym is excellent. Clean and modern with great equipment. Plenty of water provided and even cold refrigerated towels.

I especially want to share with you our experience with the staff on the Club Lounge during our visit. To say that they have a good staff is a huge understatement - they are fantastic! Each and every year that we stay at The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore we are completely blown-away by the level of professionalism that is displayed by the wonderful men and women who work there.
In particular, I want to single out Chef Sundar for his kindness and the extra care (including delicious treats) that he gifted us with during our stay. We have come to know Chef Sundar over the past few years and he continues to impress us with his kindness and tremendous work ethic. We were especially happy to see that he was still working at the hotel. (They are fortunate to have him working with them!)
We were also especially thankful to see Sherlyn who we have come to know over the years as well. She has always provided us with
exceptional service and this year she did not dissapoint.
I would be remiss if we didn't mention some of the other staff on the Club Lounge who took wonderful care of us during our stay as well. They include; Chef Andrie, Chef Benson, Hu Xian, Sabrina and Jared.
Lastly, we truly enjoyed meeting the Club Lounge Assistant Manager Chuckie and want to thank him for making sure that everything ran smoothly during our stay. He has a wonderful team and it is clear that he is is doing a great job in keeping them motivated and inspired.

We did utilize the spa, which was absolutely wonderful and a great way to relax after so much travel. Our room was comfortable and clean. We also opted for the Club Lounge, which was really convenient and had a good variety of foods and a really great staff. Additionally, if you pay for the Club Lounge, you can utilize the free car service which will drop you at various places around the Bay. It’s great, especially if you don’t relish the idea of walking around in hot, humid weather (which I don’t!) The concierge was also very helpful in arranging ticket purchases. We also ate at the Summer Pavilion which was by far the best Chinese food I’ve ever eaten in my life.
We received personalized notes from the staff, and little surprises left in our room (cookies, champagne, chocolates) which was very thoughtful. I had a birthday during my stay and the hotel even sent up a little cake with a card. Its those small things that you really remember and appreciate, especially with a large hotel like this. They made the experience very intimate even though there were so many guests.
The hotel was conveniently located, but you really do need to walk a bit to get most places. Taxis are cheap though, so if you don’t feel like walking it isn’t too expensive to grab a taxi or Grab (like Uber).
Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone. It was wonderful, the people were wonderful, and we couldn’t have asked for more. Our first time to Singapore and we can’t wait to visit again.

The Ritz-Carlton Millenia did exactly that, though. The personable treatment I got during the week I stayed there, can easily cope with any 5-star + resort who would only look at a fraction of the scale that the Ritz-Carlton Millenia has to deal with.
It’s not hard to see the handwriting of Peter Mainguy and his management team. Every staff member who I met, from the housekeeper to the front desk, to the security guy, had a smile on their face and wanted to please their guests.
And in case you get to get access to the Club Lounge, you will not only enjoy a stunning view over the Marina Bay (yes, Peter, it’s definitely more appealing to look AT the MBS, than to look out FROM it 😉), but you will also enjoy hospitality that is simply second to none!

We decided to try their daycation package for our son’s birthday and their attention to detail was amazing.
Pros
- Balloons in the room, tent set up with cushions, children’s bedroom slippers and bathrobe / toothpaste / toothbrush / TOP to toe shower gel. Everything was thought of such that we didn’t need to request anything.
- When they saw my son was fussing, they immediately brought over crayons and colouring sheets. And at breakfast arranged Mickey Mouse pancakes for him for his bday.
- room has been renovated and bed is so comfortable!
- my son loved the fish tank on level 3
- great indoor tennis court
Cons
- property is dated, not much activities for kids
- Chinese restaurant was overpriced. We had 3 kinds of dim sum, Peking duck, chrysanthemum tea, small fish porridge for my son and some spinach tofu =$300! So just be mindful things add up here, which we knew but Was quite unexpected for lunch considering we didn’t have a lot / anything exotic like lots of seafood etc.

Check-in was a breeze and we were professionally attended to by Shereen at the reception. She offered us an extra bed for the room when she saw that I was pregnant and we had two young children with us, showing her concern and wanting to ensure that we were comfortable during our stay.
When entering the room, we were amazed by the personalised decor, cake and treats prepared to welcome us as well as to celebrate our special day. Knowing we had young children with us, they provided children's play tents, balloons, soft toys, children toiletries and even cute child-sized robes and slippers. Thanks to Aisyah for making all the special arrangements for our stay when we mentioned during booking about celebrating our wedding anniversary. My family enjoyed ourselves tremendously!
Staff were warm, friendly and helpful, making us feel so welcome. My parents visited us for awhile during the staycation, and they were impressed by the friendly and approachable Mohammad who kept them company while awaiting their Grabcar at the hotel lobby as they were leaving for home. We also experienced many other personalised touch from the hotel staff such as bringing us towels and cool drinks while we were at the pool, bringing up our food delivery orders to the room etc making us feel like we were treated like VIPs!

Upon arrival, we were greeted by the friendly and professional staff at the front desk. After the quick check-in procedure,
we were led to the lift lobby by the front desk staff while he introduced all the amenities within the hotel.
First impression of the room was that it was spacious, cozy and very well-furnished. There is a Smart-TV that allows Apple Airplay
(sadly, does not link with iOS Netflix app), Android Screen Mirroring and even Bluetooth connection with your laptop(this one can stream Netflix) so you can stream your own media to the TV if needed. The TV is also connected to ceiling speakers located above the sofa and also in the bathroom so
you can still listen to the the show or music while relaxing in the deep bathtub. The room also comes with a nice Bose Bluetooth speaker
for those who want to party in their room.
Care packs,which include a hand sanitiser, an alcohol wipe and a 3-ply face mask, were provided. The mini-bar was also sanitised
for our safety(as shown on sticker).
The bathroom is grand and relatively large. The large mirrors made the bathroom less claustrophobic. It comes with a shower, a bathtub and twin basins. The toilet has a sliding door that separates it from the rest of the bathroom, the hotel understands the importance of keeping some mysteries in a relationship. It features a bidet too, a full one, not the hose kind.
The Four Seasons mobile app allows easy communication with the staff. You can order room-service, ask for ice or chat with the friendly staff if you are lonely.
We have ordered room service and the food came within 20 minutes. The food was kept steaming hot when served and we were assured that the utensils were sanitised(as shown on another sticker). Do take note that the menu seclection after 11.30pm will be limited, so don't expect Welsh lamb rump at midnight. But we all know, all food taste good after bedtime.
Housekeeping service was so good it's like Mrs Doubtfire cleaned the room. Clothes and towels left in the bathroom were nicely folded, they even made the effort to coil up the phone charging cable that was left on the bedside table. Everything was arranged nicely when we returned to the room. Also, arrangement were made during hotel check-in to minimise contact with the housekeeping staff to keep both us and the staff safe.
All in all, the whole staycation experience was pleasant and we felt taken care of. Service was warm and top-notch and the safety precautions were well taken.

The boulevard room was stunning with its newly renovated room and the endless views of Orchard Road and a glimpse of Marina Bay. Every aspect of the room to the bathroom were so nice and cozy, not to mention the ceiling speakers where the sofa were was very thoughtful of the designer. I also ordered room service for dinner and lunch, both being delicious and delivery was very time-efficient. I would like to commend the FS App, where chatting is so easy and replies came within minutes!
Went to both pools, the rooftop pool has more of a family friendly vibe to it while the gym level has a more athletic feel. I personally prefer the rooftop pool as it has a panoramic view of the surrounding areas and more daybeds/lounges. Encountered only one pool staff, Chee Sheng, and he was very hospitable and cheerful which made my lounging more relaxing.
Breakfast was a shock to me as it is not ala-carte buffet style but rather a set and a choice of hot food. Despite that, the food was very tasteful and to my surprise quite filling.
All the staff were very hospitable and accommodating. Although the exterior and some parts looks dated, it is still one of the best in terms of service and there's even a link-bridge to Orchard Road, what's not to like?",Date of stay: September 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Orchard,,

Four Seasons definitely did not let me down. I was blown away by the rooms and interior as compared to the exterior of the hotel which looks rather old and gloomy. However, all that changes the very moment you took a step inside. The rooms were not so recently renovated but it is still very modern and Clean.
I've stayed in their one-bedroom suite which had so much space. The TV in the suite was huge and the view of the city is Gorgeous. The facilities, such as the gym and pool was well maintained and managed.
I was there for my Belated Birthday staycation and had booked the room under the ""Take Your Time' Package which allows me to have a 24-hour stay in the room. I checked in at 10 pm and had my checkout time at 10 pm as well the next day.
It's indeed a pity that they did not have an all you can eat ala carte buffet menu for guest like many other five-star hotels, but the breakfast set is sufficient. (You have to pay for additional bread, Juice and even Special coffee ie. Cappuccino, Latte.)
Service was beyond expectations, warm and pleasant. They even have the Four Season App which allows you to chat with the hotel for any request possible. The app was a delight to use as the service staff was very responsive, unlike other hotels that offer the same services.

The Four Seasons team in Singapore, right from the front desk to their restaurants were super warm, friendly and went the extra mile to make it a special experience for us. The attention to detail was amazing. I forgot my mousepad and was using a book... the housekeeping team noticed that and just got a mousepad organized for my laptop with a little note. They remember your name and your food and drink preferences. We had a bit of a roof leak situation in our room and they were very quick in getting us a new and upgraded room.

Other brands might claim to be premium in Singapore but this truly is. I will return for my next staycay.
Minor suggestion, consider making the downstairs pool the family pool and the upstairs one an adult pool. The downstairs one is way bigger and suited to families, upstairs is quite serene... Until the kids come!
All in all highly recommended.",Date of stay: September 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Orchard,,

As we have a baby girl, Four Seasons communicated with us before our arrival to find out her age so that they can make the necessary arrangements - eg provided some diapers, baby wash and even a thoughtful diaper bin. Of course, because it was a birthday staycation the cake was already set up in the room during our check in. In addition the staff were all very accommodating to our requests during the stay. We had three staycations since hotels opened for staycation in Singapore and Four Seasons hands down had the best service.

The Bar is really comfy and nicely decorated, I loved the fact that the decoration is luxurious and the ambiance very quite and suitable for a girly chit chat.

I didnt try much of the sparkling teas as I am not a bubbles fan but my friend highly enjoyed it. My white tea was delicious as was the mocha (strong and corsé like I prefer it).
The food was very tasty and offered plenty of choices, I particularly loved the truffle eggs sandwich as well as the chocolate financier (would have loved to have more of these!), the scones were very well cooked and the rose strawberries jam was a nice perfect combination for the warm scones.

We took a suite connecting to a boulevard room. As our home was under renovation during this period, and we had to bring our dog with us, we were very happy that Four Seasons accommodated us as our understanding is that it is a dog friendly hotel.
Our stay was very comfortable and we were made to feel very much at home. No request was turned away by the staff. There are too many of them to compliment but we would like to especially mention Yen Ling who arranged our stay, and who graciously allowed us a little more time to check out as our renovations were not complete. We also compliment Tuck Wah who responded quickly to our feedback.
Room wise, the beds are luxurious and very comfy, and relatively large in size compared to other suites and rooms elsewhere. Every feedback we gave during our stay received attention and we received calls and visits from the managers who wanted to ensure that we were comfortable and that our needs were met.
Our daughter celebrated her birthday during the stay and it was memorable. We appreciated the birthday cakes she received from the hotel, arranged by the staff.
We would recommend this property to others who are seeking a quick getaway staycation, during these difficult times where travel is not possible. I would give the elegance of this property, service and staff attention, 5 stars.",Date of stay: August 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Orchard,,

The style of the building, the shape of rooms, etc are all from the 80'.
The service is the usual from FS, ie; very good. The only downside was arriving from a 25 hour flight, only to find the hotel bar closing early (basically in our face). They really should rethink this. A lot of the clientele arrive late at night and having a glass of wine would have been appreciated.
The roof top pool is very clean, but lacks charm. A few chaise longue, few plants and that's it.
The absolute best part of the hotel is breakfast. It is the BEST breakfast buffet I have experience in the world. No words can do it justice.
Lastly, note that hotel is not downtown. It's further north, in a nice shopping area. But you're not at all where the action is. The metro is quite efficient in Singapore, so going downtown is easy, but for the same price, you could be much closer to where most tourist or business travelers want to be.
I'm usually a raving fan of FS, that's why I chose it in the first place. But for the location only, I would pick another hotel next time.",Date of stay: September 2019,,3,,,,,,,,Orchard,,

The location is great, not far from Orchard.
The room reminds me of Four Seasons HK, the layout is quite the same.
The bed is comfortable but the thing i dislike is the air-condition. It is quite hot. Although I try to adjust it to the lowest 19C, it is still not cool enough (That trip I stay at Ritz and Raffles before Four Seasons, so I know that it is not the degree I wanted it to be).
And the room has some smell, it is not bad smell, bit it is not fresh.
The reception I met, Miku, she is the best of the best. Her attitude and her hospitality made me give the 5 stars rating to the hotel despite the comment I gave about the room.
The another thing I really like is the staff and the quality of your Michelin Chinese restaurant. Everything is great.

We did not opt for breakfast as it was something like 45 USD pp! We did however take advantage of the free nibbles in the bar area from 5:30-6:30pm with an amazing cocktail. We ate at the Michelin star Jiang-Nan Chun (Chinese) and I highly recommend it. The pool area was fab and we managed to get a cabana and were offered complimentary iced tea.
Location wise if you are into designer shopping (I am not) then Orchard Road is on your door step. We walked to get some ice cream haha. I would recommend downloading the Grab app for cheap taxis (Asian version of Uber) and we paid a visit to Sentosa Island (don’t bother), Gardens by the Bay, Raffles and Newton food market (from Crazy Rich Asians) for cheap authentic food. All in all the Four Seasons was one of the best hotels we have ever stayed in and we will use the brand again.",Date of stay: February 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Orchard,,

As we always prefer to stay at Four Seasons, we booked here. Their concept of hospitality is miles ahead every other brand. We were given an amazing room at the 18th floor and when we arrived everything was ready without even requesting for an early check in- the hotel was full due to Chinese New Year (early check in at 12:30pm). A great surprise was there for the birthday people as well (check fotos attached). The view was amazing, the bathroom was amazing, the ambience was fresh and clean.
Breakfast was complete and I still cannot forget those divine cranberry muffins. We also had dinner at One Ninety once. The food was good but what I have to say is that we ordered plain kids spaghetti with parmesan on the side for our daughter and the portion was insanely small. We had to make an additional order as the amount served was ok for an infant rather than a kid (12$ each order). This was the only detail we would have pointed out regarding our dining experience here. Other than that, room service was fast and delicious. We ordered pizza, club sandwich, lemongrass ice cream and a divine apple pie! Also my husband took a 90mins massage at the spa and he really enjoyed it. I am pregnant so could not follow him. Next time :).
The hotel is conveniently located right close to the shopping district and also within walking distance to the Botanical Garden and short driving distance to Sentosa island.
4 days were not enough for us! We will be back for sure! Keep up the amazing work Four Seasons!",Date of stay: January 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Orchard,,

The location is perfect for our needs, near Orchard Road but removed enough to be a quiet oasis. The hotel is small and peaceful. Our favorite features are 1) a very strong gym and two pools - one adults only (thank you!) located at the gym and one for all ages on the roof; 2) excellent Food and Beverage. Evening room service is above and beyond, the restaurant breakfast is excellent. It’s a buffet but of a much higher quality than any other hotel in Singapore and more peaceful; 3) the hotel looks much better after a recent renovation. The rooms finally have decent TV’s and a much needed refresh. If we had any quibbles, it’s that the desk can sometimes be a bit robotic - sometimes they forget we have stayed before while other times we are old friends. The new rooms have great TV’s but not one HD channel and no way to plug in an HDMI cable (it’s obscured by the TV mounting). They have a poorly performing version of ChromeCast for the TV but it often fails. An HDMI input would be appreciated. Nevertheless, it’s a great hotel and offers service above and beyond anywhere else in Singapore in our view.",Date of stay: November 2019,,5,,,,,,,,Orchard,,

All the staff are friendly and welcoming. There is a walk way from the hotel to a small mall and then down to the Hilton which is on the main Orchard Road and then all shops, restaurants, bus routes etc are clearly accessible. They allowed us to check in early at 10:30am and check out late at 3pm. Rooms are spacious with a large bed and tv, coffee/ tea making facilities and large bathroom with bath and rain shower. Rooms are cleaned often. There is a rooftop pool but also an adult only pool on the 3rd floor with jacuzzi and free fruit and water. We often went there for a small breakfast before going out for the day. There are 2 restaurants but we only went to the restaurant bar for the weekend festive afternoon tea which was lovely.",Date of stay: December 2019,,5,,,,,,,,Orchard,,

The choice of restaurants is excellent and provides super variety. The only negative feedback is that room service gave me half a glass of wine (literally) which I had not noticed at the time as I was signing the bill. The pool is locked in the evenings which I found unusual and disappointing if you want a late night swim.,Date of stay: December 2019,Trip type: Travelled on business,5,,,,,,,,Orchard,,

I became sick with the flu and a bad cold during the third night of my stay. It must have been just before 6Am when I called the concierge for help. They immediately called the gift shop so they could get pain meds and coordinated with room service to send up a hot breakfast with a pot of ginger tea with honey and lemon on the side (just how I like it). When I felt I needed to see a doctor, they made an appointment right away with a nearby clinic.
I've stayed at this hotel numerous times and I love how the staff remembers my preferences : lots of bottled water in the room, extra clothes hangers, room view and how to handle packages that I regularly receive.
The amazing Four Seasons App is such an easy way to make requests without needing to call the hotel. They reply right away.

I am happy to report that it was every bit as good as I remembered, and even better in some ways! Thanks to Jenny for noticing that we were using a mouse without the mouse pad, and thoughtfully giving us one even when he had not asked! Concierge services were impeccable, and staff were friendly and helpful about giving directions and advise about the best way to get to our destination. Breakfast seemed better than I remembered, and staff were good about remembering what my kids had liked the previous day and giving the same item even before we had asked. Rooms were great - clean, luxurious, comfortable, as one would expect.
I do have a suggestion. We had arranged a hotel pick up at the airport. Seemed to be a hired car, not a Four Seasons car. That is not an issue - but the driver was really unfriendly. Usually limo chauffeurs say hello, provide water bottles, mention the WiFi in the car, show us some landmarks on the way to the hotel. This guy did not even say “hello” back to my husband when my husband greeted him! That was quite strange and we did not try to talk to him or ask him anything during the drive.
As I said, he did not seem to be a Four Seasons staff. But Four Seasons would do well to coordinate with contracted cars to make sure they provide drivers who are at least polite. BTW, the person who drove us from the hotel to the airport when we were leaving was a nice, normal, friendly guy.

The view was amazing, could see part of the Marina Bay Sands.
There was however no welcome drink provided but I must thank the team for an early check-in. Very thoughtful especially the fact that everyone knew our name right at the kerb. Room cleaning and Make the bed service was outstanding. Would’ve loved few complimentary cookies/fruits everyday in room. Breakfast was a tad boring especially due to repetitive food items everyday, but the thoughtful service really covered any lacuna. The doormen were super helpful especially delivering our food orders and with our shopping bags.
Would’ve loved a remote device to control the curtains and lights. Also, the TV remote was not functioning, though we hardly used it.

Justine and Aruin in the restaurant were very welcoming, enthusiastic and went above and beyond to make sure I was enjoying my whole stay in singapore not only in the hotel but they were giving me lots of helpful tips about Singapore in general too

Rooms are large and elegant, stocked with everything you need - plenty of complimentary water, decent wifi, etc. There is a separate dressing table to apply makeup and style your hair, as well as plenty of space to sit and work aside from the bed.
The staff is very helpful at calling taxis, storing luggage, etc
The breakfast, which was includes in my rate, was an enourmous spread of food with selections from all over the world - eggs made to order, curries, fresh fruits, dumplings, etc.
Some very minor nits: the room is pretty dark, even with all the lights on and they aren’t all on one switch so you have to do a sweep of turning off all the lights separately at night; I guess there was some sort of welcome snack of packaged chocolate chip cookies (?) tucked into a dark corner - I assumed they were part of the mini bar offering.

Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,BritTravelLover,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/BritTravelLover,"Washington DC, District of Columbia",BritTravelLover wrote a review Sep 2019,64 contributions,Exceptional experience - understated class and luxury,"Arrived SQ21 from Newark, pre-arranged car was waiting for us at Changi, Four Seasons representative called us shortly before we passed through immigration to let us know the driver was waiting. Very comfortable transfer from airport to hotel.
On arrival at hotel, a staff member escorted us to our room and conducted check-in in the room - greatly appreciated after 17 1/2 hours in premium economy seating. A plate of cupcakes was waiting for our children, along with strawberry drinks. Children's toothbrushes and toothpaste were waiting in the bathroom in our spacious and beautifully appointed 2 queen bed room.
We enjoyed a meal at Jiang-Nan Chun, which I would highly recommend. Dress code applies but is not too restrictive (the long pants and short-sleeved polo shirt I chose to wear that day were fine), the staff made us feel very welcome and engaged with our children, most definitely a family-friendly option and providing the high quality food you would expect from a michelin-starred restaurant.
Reception staff were asked to arrange, at very short notice, a late-night cab for us to Changi (an error on my part not arranging this ahead of time). After approximately 20 minutes from our request, we were notified that it had been arranged, and we felt the rate to be very reasonable. At check-out my wife expressed that she would appreciate the same room on our return scheduled 2 weeks later.
On that second visit the car was again on time and the transfer was again comfortable. We arrived at the hotel at 1pm not expecting our room to be ready. Our bags were held for us and we went out for lunch. At 1:40pm we received a call to let us know that our room was ready. It was the room that we had stayed in during our first visit, per my wife's expressed wish. Toothbrushes and toothpaste were again provided for our children and cupcakes delivered to them as part of turn-down service.
We thoroughly enjoyed the buffet breakfast each day of each visit. Restaurant staff were fantastic accommodating our seating requests, and food was cooked to order graciously by friendly & helpful staff. Selection was enormous, my wife enjoyed the Mimosas and my children enjoyed the ""kids only"" table.
During our second visit we had afternoon tea and, as with breakfast, after having one afternoon tea we wanted afternoon tea every day. We found the quality of food excellent and the quantity sufficient to obviate the need to eat an evening meal.
We enjoyed the rooftop pool - pleasant views and delicious peach tea - and the pool adjacent to the spa. We found gym equipment to be of excellent quality and a very pleasant environment. Prior to our final departure & return to the US, I used the showers upstairs from the spa. This was perhaps the only negative - a slightly unpleasant odour in the showers, some flies in the shower, and the temperature a little too warm to avoid slightly sweating on dressing. A staff member told me that the spa may be renovated soon based on other customers' feedback.
All staff we interacted with were phenomenal, helpful, gracious, took interest in us and our children, expressed concern for the welfare of my son when tearful, and interactions with them definitely elevated our enjoyment of our visits.
We adored this place and hope it's not too long before we can return.",Date of stay: August 2019,,5,,,,,,,,Orchard,,

Fabulous room (we had a suite), exceptional service and an amazing meal at the Michelin started Chinese restaurant.
A particular call out to the concierge team who did a great job in booking various restaurants and transportation (as well as dealing with our constant changes and additions!)
We had treatments in the spa with two amazing therapists from Bali.

Located on quiet tree line area on Orchard Boulevard, just around the corner from the famous Orchard Road, Singapore's retail center, where you can find from upscale boutiques to amazing department stores and lot of dining as well.
At a 5 minutes walk from the hotel you will reach the Orchard MRT Station, from there, you can ride the North South Line that allows you to connect with most of the other lines ,which makes it very convenient to go around the city.
Our room was a deluxe city view, amazing XL Size, contemporary furniture in a relaxed ambiance decor, lots of light, very comfortable beds, luxury quality bedding and spacious marble bathroom with L'occitane body and hair shampoos.
A motivated staff, you can tell they are passionate about your experience like the assistant Manager at the restaurant Mr. Yoggaraaj Manisegaram whom was very attentive during the breakfast (two thumbs up for the Bkfst)) and was always focused on customer needs. Also I want to thank Mr Tangyu (sorry if it is misspelled), a very helpful Bell Boy.
The roof top swimming pool was ok. The other one with the jacuzzi located on the third floor very relaxing.
Making this long story short, If I have the opportunity to go back to Singapore, I already know where to stay : Four Seasons.",Date of stay: August 2019,,5,,,,,,,,Orchard,,

I've been coming to Spore for work+leisure since 6 years ago and stay about a week each visit. It was my first time staying with Four Seasons Spore, my choice was usually near the MBS, not Orchard. I don't think I will ever go back to the MBS area from now. I liked the slightly remote location and the fact that it was still a walking distance to malls and metro (they are all connected from Wheelock Center). I heard from a local friend that the hotel itself has been there forever but the facilities are very nicely maintained. I cannot emphasize how delicious the Peking duck and the sweet and sour pork at the Chinese restaurant is.

Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,Bradley,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/elatable,"Palo Alto, California",Bradley wrote a review Aug 2019,21 contributions,Comfortable and understated,"I've become a frequent business traveler to this part of town, and tried several options before settling on the Four Seasons as my base. The hotel has understated elegance. It's not flashy or conspicuous (and I mean that as a compliment.) The location is great... you're minutes from Orchard Road, but also tucked away and separate. The Lobby is beautiful and quiet. The service is helpful and efficient.
I stayed in a Four Seasons Executive Suite, which has a fantastic (if somewhat extravagant for a single traveler) layout. There is a master bedroom, a living / sitting area, a full en suite bathroom as well as a separate powder room. The electronics are simple and easy to operate. The views are nothing spectacular, but the rooms have a wall of windows that provide good light.
There are two pools at the property, one on the third floor and one on the roof. There's an ample gym / fitness area. There is a lounge of sorts on the 3rd floor, which is probably the one area of the hotel that could use improvement. The lounge has been dead and rather uninviting every time I've visited. There is a paucity of refreshments (literally a jar of cookies) or a bowl of fruit. This isn't a problem for me, I'm just slightly confused by the lack of investment there. There is a full-service spa, and I received a massage that was definitely above average (for a hotel spa.)
My package included a breakfast buffet, which I think is superb. They have a variety of western, asian and Indian offerings. Fruits, juices, pastries... eggs made to order. The buffet is ample and delicious and the ambiance is lovely.
In summary, I've found my new ""home"" in Singapore. If you are looking for a quiet, understated, exquisitely comfortable sanctuary in this part of town - this is the place.",Date of stay: August 2019,,5,,,,,,,,Orchard,,

The hotel is a veritable oasis in the city. A 5 minute walk to the city’s most upscale shopping, and less than a 10 minute walk to the nearest MTR, the hotel is conveniently located. It has 2 pools (one in the roof) for cooling down, and a Michelin star Chinese restaurant on premises. We had dinner at the Chinese restaurant and it was lovely. The breakfast buffet is among the most varied I have seen with everything from fresh fruit to Asian to North American fare. Champagne mimosas were also available.
A small mishap when we arrived was quickly corrected and I appreciated the assistance of Christopher Tsoi, the Guest Experience Manager, who took extra good care of us.
Overall, we had a lovely stay and I would most certainly stay here again if my travels take me to Singapore.",Date of stay: July 2019,,5,,,,,,,,Orchard,,

Four Seasons Hotel Singapore,OhOhBug,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/OhOhBug,"Boise, Idaho",OhOhBug wrote a review Aug 2019,114 contributions,Very poor for a Four Seasons,"Four Seasons has a special place in our heart because we were engaged at the Koh Samui resort and ever since then have made every effort to ""knock off"" Four Seasons in the countries we visit. Normally in any other hotel, it will not matter but due to the recognition and prestige you would expect from a Four Seasons, our experience was terrible.
Before we go into the bad, I would like to recognize the amazing staff. All the FS that we have been to have had amazing staff that provides excellent customer service, synonymous with the FS brand. They catered to an issue we had right away and we were thoroughly pleased. The bedding was also typical FS excellence where we can just melt away at night after a long night around town.
Now to the unfortunate parts.
1) The third floor is horrendous. My wife has already reviewed the dated interior but I take particular offense with the way the aquarium is left unkempt and the poor fishes inside it. I scube dive alot so this one pains me the most to see the clown fish all by himself in a tank that is dirty. If you look at one of my pictures you will see a dead clownfish by the water filter. It has obviously been there a long time since you can see the body has started to rot. The other pictures also show how the water filter is pretty dirty and the entire tank coral system has lots of algae. This is pretty much neglect and borderline animal cruelty. It amounts to a human being being locked in a house under dirty conditions and a dead body rotting in one corner.
2) Again on the third floor and on the top floor. The pools and surrounding have seen better days. You can see in one of the picture of the chipping paint from the hot tub. Everything else is dated and bleh. For a FS type resort, I expect better, think infinity pools and great views (you are in Orchard Rd) from the pool.",Date of stay: July 2019,,1,,,,,,,,Orchard,,

We made use of the complimentary cocktails each of the three nights we stayed here and even ate at the hotel before we explored after a long flight. It can be a little busy but the staff are more than happy to take your order for drinks - and they don’t scrimp on measures either! You’re less than a 10 minute walk to the MRT at Orchard Road which means you’re only a stones throw away to get anywhere around the city. A nice touch was the complimentary piece of laundry each which was returned on the same day if we dropped it off at reception before 10:30am.

We'd only had three days there before as a stopover and loved the hotel and Singapore so much we thought we'd go for a week this time as an anniversary treat! We were delighted to find that the format at the Quincy was unchanged. As before, our stay included breakfast and evening meal, with afternoon tea and snacks also available. Of course there is fabulous food to be had all over Singapore, but the Quincy offers a varied selection of mainly (but not all) Asian themed dishes which are delicious and plentiful. Drinks are generously supplied, and the Singapore Slings are potent and authentic! The Dining Room staff are pleasant and very helpful (our thanks to Kumar and the rest of the team). In fact all the hotel staff are excellent, nothing is too much trouble. Also included in the price is the facility to have two clothing items laundered per day, which is a big plus with the high temperatures and humidity. There is pool on the 12th floor where towels and refrigerated soft drinks are provided. There is also a gym, sauna and steam room.
As for Singapore itself, while modern buildings now outnumber traditional ones, the temples and other places of worship are magnificent. The number of jaw-dropping attractions that have been added since we were last there is staggering, with the gardens at Marina Bay and the the nightly light show featuring giant metallic trees a must-see. In the centre of town the vast Botanic Gardens are in my top three favourite places on Earth! Singapore is spotlessly clean and almost crime-free. You don't see graffiti, cigarette butts or chewing gum. Travelling around is easy, and their subway rail system (the MRT) is the best I've seen.
I thoroughly recommend the Quincy Hotel and Singapore.",Date of stay: February 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Orchard,,

The design was simple with printed photos on the bed and balloons on the floor. Nevertheless, it was an effort but considering the amount paid, it might not be worth the top up. There was a slice of cake provided during the evening cocktail and polaroid photo for us to keep.
Our initial room assigned was not cold and not sure if it was due to the very warm weather outside or air con wasn't working well. The technician came to fix it and we left it on for another 2h+ but it was still warm despite it being at 16 degrees. Hotel staff managed to get us a new room and extended our check out time which we were grateful for as we intended to spend most of our time in the hotel instead of going out. The staff's customer service is commendable despite us calling the front desk couple times due to the room temperature.
Pros: Clean hotel, complimentary mini bar, light refreshments provided in the afternoon, evening cocktail, in room bath-tub for some bubble bath and comfortable bed
Cons: TV not in high definition and has limited channels, hotel tucked at the corner of orchard road",Date of stay: March 2020,,4,,,,,,,,Orchard,,

It is a couple of blocks from the upscale Orchard Road stores. It is a short taxi or subway ride to most sights. You could walk, but it is quite hot and humid. My room was modern and clean. The air conditioning worked well. It was very quiet. I did not hear any noise. The room was stocked each day with complimentary coke and other drinks. And three small bags of chips and snacks. They serve snacks during the day in the restaurant. I ate dinner at the restaurant every night. The food was good and the alcoholic drinks were included, which is a huge benefit in a city with expensive alcohol prices. The staff were very helpful and kind. After the first day they knew me and what I liked to drink. I did not have any complaints or issues with the hotel. I highly recommend it.",Date of stay: February 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Orchard,,

As always, they have the best service I have seen in a hotel. I have not seen such a friendly, professional, helpful and a unparalleled service in any hotel I have stayed in (from super luxury 5 star hotel to a low end hotel). I am simply amazed with the warmth of the service of the staff.
As I always say in my comments about this hotel, the best asset they have are the staff.
Apart from friendly smiles and helpful major gestures the small things that these people do are the best. We went out for a walk and suddenly it started raining, and we got wet. As soon as we enter the hotel, one of the receptionists grabbed a tissue box and came to us and offered them to us to wipe our faces and head. It is a small gesture, but very thoughtful and admirable.
In the restaurant they offer free breakfast and dinner (both buffet). The number of items may not be much but the items they offer are very high in quality. The staff in the restaurant were eager to help us and super friendly.
It is so refreshing to enjoy their hospitality after a tiring day.
Compared to my earlier visits there are some wear and tear in the hotel (rooms, etc.) but they are well maintained, so nothing to complain.

There were a small selection of local foods daily which were just okay and as for requesting eggs to order - 2 eggs presented on a small bread plate with one on top of the other , thats right the egg on the bottom was munted (on both occasions, shameful the kitchen staff could see this).

They accommodated us with early check in and provided complimentary mini bar drinks and snacks. They even have a Japanese style bidet toilet! A very nice Breakfast buffet was provided and during the day fresh fruit juices and a soft serve ice cream machine were available. In the evening appetizers, wine and cocktails were offered. The staff are extremely helpful at helping you plan your sight-seeing, ordering taxis etc. If you book your room directly with the hotel they will launder 2 items for free! All in all it's a great hotel and I've already recommended it to my friends who are traveling to Singapore in March 2020. We plan on coming back to Singapore and we'd definitely stay here again.

Rooms are big and our king sized bed was so comfortable I slept the best in the 3 weeks travelling. Bath, rainfall shower, toiletries and not just your usual shower gel and shampoo but dental kit, shower cap, moisturiser and cotton buds. Breakfast was included and is buffet style with lots of hot and cold choice. Between 6pm and 8 they serve canapés but this is really dinner with free drink including alcohol. They have a free mini bar in the room which is stocked with soft drinks, crisps and nuts daily.
The lobby has cute dog and cat pillows, the dog ones are shaped like they are climbing up the sofa and peering out. They are arranged differently every day.
We had a late flight and could keep our room until 6 for a small cost. They also had an airport transfer in a Mini Cooper. I would definitely stay here again. It was just so quirky but perfect.

Close to Orchard Road, but not smack dab in the middle of it all. If you like to walk, this is an ideal place. About a half hour from the Botanical Garden. About 15 minutes from the heart of the shopping district. About 35-40 minutes from Raffles and the Long Bar. But the walks are pleasant and scenic. Solid breakfast. Night time happy hour with food is exceptional. Don't even have to do out for dinner as they supply it. Front desk staff is friendly and helpful. Had some computer/VPN issues and they got it resolved. If we ever get back to Singapore -- which is unlikely -- we'd stay here again. By the way, it's super moderne.

1) Checked in ( booked 2? months in advance) -request high floor -receptionist clueless -eventually agreed lower floor -then room no electricity !-called after 20 minutes engineer arrived -took 20 minutes -could not fix -ok this happens?
2) Went downstairs -then about to get a new room -they decided to test all the electricity in the Hotel -Hello 1pm on a Friday afternoon ?-are the mgt clueless?
3) Waited 20 minutes then electricity started again! no elevators light etc.
4) Swimming pool closed -In Singapore-ok can use pool next door -why not notified? -could have booked another Hotel.
5) Best part of Quincy is outside deck area where you can relax at night time-GUESS WHAT CLOSED! -Who is running this Hotel?? - changing decking -this with planning could have been done overnight with no inconvenience to guests.
6) Result I have no evening cocktails -but also have to say food gone down -just for evening cocktail -Deep fried fish, fish dish in tomato sauce, and pasta in tomato sauce -sad sad sad! -Breakfast Croissants -baked two/three days ago?
7) Reception staff a disaster, Duty Manager a disaster -only good thing is Lady in Restaurant and Waiter who I have known for years -both just great -but really food like 10 ten years ago ( was garbage then -maybe 10 year celebration/recreation or something ???) after than much better and really good-now again garbage -sorry.
8) Will I stay here again ?-lets see -two days to go-too lazy to move to another Hotel- plus pre-paid anyhow and location great -will eat outside -as room now has electricity etc ( he he) -sometime hot water takes a long time!
9) Manage a Hotel myself in Indonesia so can understand some of the reasons -but really bad Management and Project Management here -bordering on stupidity and incompetence -never once did I receive an apology for taking 1.5 hours to get to my room -ok first room electrical failures can happen ( Engineer when he arrived was great but could not solve issue) -but then testing the electricity on a Friday afternoon and shutting down elevators etc -just STUPID STUPID STUPID !

We stayed here for 2 nights and the service and facilities were flawless. I enjoyed the evening cocktails served daily from 6pm-8pm it was by far one of the best we have had. The room was clean and the gym and sauna was a plus point. The hotel was getting ready for Christmas and they put up a beautiful Christmas ladder up at the lobby, such a unique idea it looked beautiful when it was lit up at night!

The room and hotel in general was beautifully designed. Clean, fresh, modern and comfortable. The pool wasn’t working at time of stay which was unfortunate but we were offered to use next door’s pool. The gym was adequate for a hotel gym and well maintained. The breakfast was decent. The cocktail and nibbles were a lovely touch, and the staff were just delightful. My only complaint would be the location which is quite far from the centre. Taxis cheap so not too much of an issue.

The hotel provides breakfast and snacks during the day but unfortunately they provided very limited vegan options despite asking about food requests in advance- I ended up ordering a food delivery service as they couldn’t provide any vegan sandwiches/cakes and I was only offered lettuce and fruit.
Room cleaning didn’t take place until late afternoon on both days of my stay.
The hotel is in a quiet area but a bit too far away from everything, about 15 minutes walk to Orchard mrt.

The staff are excellent and hospitality is super. It’s the little things and for me it was when I was a little ill and got laryngitis.
It was 3am and I needed to find a pharmacy which they helped with and when I came back the receptionist (can’t recall her name unfortunately) had a cup of honey and lemon waiting for me.

Breakfast and a light dinner ( and wine/ beer/ cocktails ) were included every day - we were very happy with the variety of food offered and the service provided.
Finally, the hotel provides a lovely indoor pool and well equipped fitness center for the use of their guests. Both areas were well maintained and the pool in particular, was beautiful and very relaxing.

The hotel is conveniently located, only a short walk from Orchard Road. The room is very clean and tidy and I loved the Kevin Murphy amenities. The rate includes breakfast and cocktails every day, which was a plus point.
The staff at the restaurant were welcoming and the food tasted really good, great varitety which is simple yet sufficient. I used the gym Everyday and the equipment and music in the gym were ideal. Pool was great and was nice to sit by during day time, it was never crowded.
The staff at the reception were friendly and always ready to help. Thank you to the hotel manager Ms. Fernando who had a friendly chat now and then and even recommended things to do and see in Singapore. Quincy was great! Definitely a hotel I would recommend to my friends back home. I will return, Thank you all!",Date of stay: October 2019,,5,,,,,,,,Orchard,,

The return can be longer because it's uphill. Friendly and helpful front desk. The servers during breakfast is not so attentive, so maybe that can be improved.

My night there went well. I requested for a wine bucket and wine glasses upon check-in. It was rather late at night and the male staff at the front desk was very helpful in trying to accomodate my request for these items. He explained that the wine buckets were all borrowed out and even sent it up to the room five minutes later when it was ready. That was pretty awesome and quick service, I must say.
The room I had for the night was one of the most spacious ones I’ve stayed in around the Orchard area.I especially loved the interior design and colour play used in the bathroom from the sleeping area. There was a rainshower plus a bathtub, cushy bathrobes plus a set of delicious smelling shower essentials by Kevin Murphy。
I spent alot of time sitting by the bay window area looking out at the night having my wine.
The bed was huge and comfortable. But before I knew it, the morning alarm on my phone went off. Got showered and headed to the lobby restaurant for a bite.
I didn’t have much time before my Grab ride to work arrived so i quickly got my croissants toasted, buttered and jammed up and scoffed it all down with two cups of English breakfast tea.
I will be back for a proper staycation to enjoy all the other perks the next time round.
A huge thank you goes out to Ms Shakila :)
Well done, everyone at Quincy!

Staff are exceptionally friendly and very courteous. Nothing too much trouble and so accommodating. A very happy bunch of staff.
Rooms are great - very clean and a bonus to have a free fridge bar in your room offering cokes, orange juices etc along with some nibbles. No alcohol in the 2 rooms we booked but this may have been down to kids staying with us.
Laundry - 2 items per day cleaned free of charge as part of package. Put in at 10am and back in your room before 7pm.
Food - exceptional and very tasty. You would never go hungry at this hotel. Plenty of choice on the menu. Best thing ever you can have breakfast, afternoon cakes, supper all in the hotel price and on top of that free alcohol between 6pm to 8.30pm. Not glasses of alcohol but full bottles delivered to your table. Also unlimited non-alcoholic and alcoholic cocktails. As soon as your bottle or glass is empty, along comes another one! Free unlimited coffee, tea, juices and icecream 24/7 in the lobby area of the hotel. We had lunch out and came back for an early supper before heading back out again to visit night time attractions.
Amenities (open 24/7) - Gym, Pool, Sauna and Steam Room. Lovely to sit on the 12th floor pool open on each side, observing the sites around you - very relaxing.
Location - central to the main shopping area and also walking distance for MRT. Taxi prices unbelievably low compared to UK. Taxi from Airport cost us 30 dollars - 40 minute trip from airport to hotel. Around Singapore for trips to different sites around 15 dollars max. Price for MRT was 10 dollars per person unlimited travel pass for one day. We used both MRT and Taxi. MRT easy, efficient and very clean. 2 MRT near hotel - Orchard (in the shopping precinct or the quieter Newton on Scotts Road by The Prudential Office. Both 10 min walk max from hotel.
Overall would highly recommend and going by comments from other guests they had recommendations from friends to stay there.
Small and friendly hotel. If you prefer attentive service this is the place to stay with all the benefits of a 'club facility'.",Date of stay: October 2019,,5,,,,,,,,Orchard,,

We picked what we thought looked like the nicest hotel closest to the Airport without having to venture into the downtown area. Both the hotel and the area were fabulous and much better than expected. The hotel is right next door to a big shopping Mall & immediately in front of the hotel are several restaurants. The hotels own restaurant Baba Chews is where we dined for Dinner and the atmosphere, service and food were excellent. Across the road is an immaculately restored block of shops and restaurants, the area is just gorgeous and we were disappointed we didn’t have time to explore.
We stayed in a king bed deluxe room and it was fabulous. Tastefully decorated, spotlessly clean and well designed. For the amount of floor space the layout was exceptionally roomy. We loved the little touches everywhere and the cool bathroom set up with the attractive vanity and shower behind it, unusual with the shower on the outside wall of the hotel. Just remember that as well as you seeing out, people can also see in to you! All features of the room worked well, from the quiet Air conditioning to the fast wifi. We ventured up to the rooftop to see the view and liked the look of the rooftop swimming pool but the weather wasn’t kind enough for us to fancy a swim!
The biggest regret was having to leave and we look forward to returning sometime for a longer stay and a good look around the area as well as experiencing some more of the restaurants in the area.",Date of stay: January 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Marine Parade,,

I had never stayed at an Indigo property, and I cannot wait to visit at another one. The decor is modern with traditional elements. The hotel has thought of every thoughtful touch. I don't want to ruin the surprises, but everywhere you look, there is an element of Peranakan culture or tradition from the foot wash tub to the candy treats. Ask the hotel to explain the room in full detail.
The hotel is in the Katong area, which is near the airport. However, it's not in the central region of Singapore. Spend at least one night in Katong even if you want to stay in Central Singapore. The area is fantastic, and it's become a hipster-style neighborhood with incredible foodie destinations.
The staff was helpful and gracious. The breakfast is yummy and extensive. The hotel is bookable using an annual IHG free night from the Chase IHG credit card.
I can't say enough wonderful things about my stay. Thank you for making my stay so memorable.",Date of stay: March 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Marine Parade,,

Hotel Indigo Singapore Katong,Toothless,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/ToothlessSG,"Singapore, Singapore",Toothless wrote a review Mar 2020,246 contributions,Tastefully Decorated Comfort with Great Service,"The first impression was refreshing. You're greeted by a greenery wall and greenery around the property before entering. The main glass door of the lobby is not directly at the building entrance, giving it privacy and probably a nod to the traditional Peranakan house entrance, where it typically require a detour around a wall upon entering.
The lobby was small and long but had Peranakan items around the area. There was the beautiful sets of rectangular carriers that resembled the Bakul Sia and had jars stacked up near the elevator. There were even side tables with Peranakan motifs at the front desk. What accompanied these beautiful decorations were the warmth and friendliness of the front desk staff. Check-in was smooth and the staff were helpful. They acceded to my request to change from a King Bed room to one with Twin Beds. My room view was of the courtyard between Hotel Indigo and another IHG property, the Holiday Inn Express.
The room was decent-sized with the shower/makeup area taking up the back quarter of the room where the window was. The bathroom however, was separate at the front of the room. The room was dotted with Peranakan-inspired furniture and nostalgic items. There was a beautiful red sofa with a carrom board table with its own play pucks. The wall had a large mural and mine depicted a durian stall in operation. There was an antique-looking cabinet that encompasses the mini-fridge and minibar items. A French press came with the complimentary coffee sachets and TWG tea bags. There were several mugs and glasses for use in addition to the old-school coffee cups. They even provided complimentary candies in glass jars (including the white rabbit milk candy!).
The shower area was separated by sliding doors and had Peranakan-styled floor tiles. The sink was on a table top that was placed on a re-purposed Singer sewing machine. The towels were placed on a low wooden stool with the spittoon beside it. There was a large old-school rope chair that was pretty comfortable. They even provided a metal bucket/tub for washing/soaking your feet and it came with the bath salts. The shower was hidden behind the sink area. Curtains and blinds were provided to ensure privacy during shower.
The location of the hotel was superb as it was near a few small malls and had plenty of food establishments in the Katong area. It was also a 10-minute to 15-minute walking distance away to Parkway Parade, a large mall. Check-out was smooth and quick. It is a very good place to stay in for both tourists and locals alike.",Date of stay: March 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Marine Parade,,

The third and fourth were also in August of 2018 and 2019 to watch the National Day Parade on a large screen while enjoying all the good food and kuih-kuih in the area. Obvious to say we absolutely love this ‘Peranakan’ themed hotel for the most part because we hail from Peranakan backgrounds and appreciate the thoughts, ideas, inspiration, knowledge and creativity that have gone into the development of this unique establishment, which has not only won our hearts over but has become our ‘home-away-from-home’. It was good to be met by familiar front office staff like Esther and Tuah (and Faris) who recognized my mother (this is important for an elderly person). The reservations manager was able to secure our favourite room on the fifteenth floor which is near the lift and convenient for my mother who requires the use of a wheelchair. The décor of the rooms are simply charming, with large black pencil-like sketches across the white wall depicting scenes reminiscent of my mother’s time, in stark contrast to the vibrant colours of the rest of the furniture and furnishings. The toilet is a separate cubicle as you enter the room, which works out well for us as there is a sink and a bidet which is convenient for my elderly mother to use. The main bathroom at the end of the room boasts a separate shower area (with rainforest and handheld options), an absolutely beautiful vanity top with a modern sink set atop an old fashioned Singer sewing machine (the type my aunt used to work on) with a large decorative mirror with amber lighting. Other old-school items include a colourful enamel basin, tray and pot, little wooden stools for the towels and wooden clogs on display (not for use). Both toilet and bathroom areas are adorned with beautiful Peranakan tiles floor-to-ceiling. If you choose the Premier Room – View with tub, you will get to enjoy soaking in a large free-standing round tub big enough for two with soaking salts, foot scrub and foot balm provided. With large floor-to-ceiling glass windows at the bathroom area, do remember to close the curtains/blinds when taking a shower or bath. There is a large paneled sliding door separating the bathroom from the bed and sitting area which makes the décor even more unique along with the lighted decorative boxed ceiling. In keeping with Peranakan tradition of loving all things bright and beautiful, the sofa/chairs, cushions, pouffe/stool, carpets, side tables and lamps are in brilliant attractive colours. Stunning! Even the large glass cabinet is a bright purple with a few pieces of traditional crockery for decoration. In here you will find a modern Nespresso machine (Premier Room) and TWG tea. There are pouches of decaffeinated coffee if you prefer along with a French Press. If you are a carom fan, you can use the game board (carom men and striker provided) to pass your time. Otherwise, the board doubles as a coffee table for you to enjoy your rice dumplings or traditional Nyonya kuih (cakes and delicacies) that can be bought from the stalls nearby. Buffet breakfast is served at Baba Chew’s Bar & Eatery – also beautifully decorated in Peranakan fashion yet looking totally modern and classy. You access the restaurant by walking through the gorgeous hotel lounge area and exiting through the glass doors to this standalone building. Juices, freshly baked French pastries, fresh fruits, yogurt, cereals, salad etc are from the buffet counters while several choices of main courses are from the menu with a daily option of alternating local favourites. The wait staff work really hard to get your hot breakfast options prepared and served along with freshly brewed coffee and teas so do be patient especially when the restaurant is busy. What is unique to me is that Baba Chew’s is set in the same building as the former Joo Chiat Police Station which is where I was once attached during my NPCC (National Police Cadet Corps) days. Both these names are connected to Mr Chew Joo Chiat (1857-19260), who was also known as the 'King of Katong'. From our favourite room I can also view my old school along Ceylon Road. How nostalgic is that! The rooftop infinity pool is quite sizeable and makes for a good view and a good swim. My only issue is that I hope the hotel management will look into installing grab bars in the toilet and shower area, not only for the convenience of elderly and/or handicapped but for the general safety of all guests, especially since the (lovely) floor tiles in the shower are rather smooth (licin). My mother is already looking forward to yet another stay in 2020. Congrats to a great team (including Prem) that made the stay so enjoyable and pleasant. And thank you Jennifer Vivian for your warm welcome and attention. This makes a lot of difference to me and my mother. I love the amenities at this hotel, the warmth and flexibility of the staff and the overall 'homeliness' of the environment.",Date of stay: August 2019,,5,,,,,,,,Marine Parade,,

So did not really have much expectations when made a booking for staycation. Glad to say that the property did not disappoint and we had a good time.
The check in was efficient and staff was friendly and gave the usual info on breakfast and check out timing before issuing the room key. Similarly, checking out was hassle free, the whole process took less than 5 minutes.
The room like the rest of the hotel have a strong Peranakan influence which is nice as it blends well with the whole Katong area. There are several nice touches that made the stay specially memorable like offering free candy commonly found from one’s childhood, a table that also doubles as a carrom board which you can play on. The room we had also offered a great view of whole Katong neighborhoods.
The housekeeping team deserves a pat on their back as the room is always clean and basic amenities refilled. Whenever a request was made, their response is always prompt.
The location of the hotel is another big plus, as there are plenty of food and drink options around and for any shopaholic there are a couple of decent malls within walking distance like Katong 112 and Parkway Parade.
The main reason this review did not gets a 5 star rating is that it does not offer complimentary parking to guest, which is a disappointment considering it is such a great alternative to the usual city area hotels for staycation.

The rooms are unique and generous. The rooftop pool is exquisite.
The hotel is a very easy 10 minute cab ride from Changi Airport.
One star lost for a few reasons:
- Baba Chews is the restaurant attached to the hotel where you can get buffet breakfast in the morning (was included for us) and meals at other times of the day. The service was just OK. Maybe it was because of Lunar New Year that it was so busy, but usually restaurants would staff up for such a peak period. The delays in being attended to on arrival and the wait for coffee was not acceptable. The breakfast food was pretty good, with the exception of the Nasi Lemak, but the evening meals were not so great. I had to send back the specialty crab soup which was cold.
In terms of the hotel, the service was good. Our corridor smelt very strongly of cigarette smoke at one point, which I reported and which was fixed pretty promptly. Surprising just how many people flaunt no smoking rules in hotels!
When I called to report it, I did have to call three times before reception answered.

The room clerks were friendly and accommodating. The room had personality - lots of color and homey, traditional touches. Full floor to ceiling windows allowed for a wonderful city view but couldn’t be seen from the bed. Large shower was nice, but is tiled and I would have liked a no-slip mat for the floor. Nice touches with Nespresso machine and candies in room. My husband enjoyed the foot bath after a long day of sightseeing. The bed was comfortable. We enjoyed sitting by the rooftop pool, although the water was pretty cold. This hotel is in a walkable area with lots of restaurants and shops. However the hotel is 15-20 minutes into the city by taxi or Grab (similar to Uber). There is no MRT in the area and we were told the bus would take 45 minutes into the city.",Date of stay: January 2020,,4,,,,,,,,Marine Parade,,

Other reviews have covered most of the Pro's, a few Cons below for the hotel to note
For some reason, after we went up to our room after check in, it took ages (20 -30 mins) for reception staff to bring our bags up (we were going to bring them up ourselves but they insisted on bringing them up).
No luggage racks, despite plenty of room for them in the room
No towel rails to hang up bath towels, they had to be draped over the chairs to dry. Consider a free standing rack perhaps.
Due to the lay out of the room (with the shower/handbasin/wash area taking up half the window view therefore the expansive street/neighbour hood view not made most of and cuts out light for the room. I acknowledge that not much can be done about this now. Due to this layout, there is a double up of lounge seating areas and 2 handbasins (1 each in toilet and wash area).
Due to above layout, no soap was provided for wash area handbasin (only for toilet handbasin)
Room service is a bit lacking, there was no face cloths, and only 1 was provided on day 2.
I requested another tea bag from housekeeping, they said 'okay', sent somebody to knock on the door, my partner answered and requested more toilet rolls. We didn't get either. Their room tidy is done very very quickly, all over in less than 15 mins.
I was a bit shocked to see frayed towels, the centre part of the towels were fine but the edges had frayed threads hanging off them. Housekeeping needs to check and send to menders and not put into a guest room, unsightly and poor look.
3 varieties of Sweets are a nice touch but unnecessary (would have preferred an extra teabag myself)
Power points were not located in bath/wash room areas or near mirrors, therefore it's hard to see what you're doing with your hair when blow drying it.
One side if the bed had 1 power point but used for bedside lamp, perhaps a power board could be provided as another outlet for charging devices (a couple will more than likely have 2 or more devices these days)
I particularly liked the funky decor in the room, reception, conservatory area's and the nice breakfasts from Baba Chews's.
As it rained continuously for 2 of the days, and we did find malls to shop in; this area is a good 45 min bus ride from Orchard Road shopping and it is not connected (yet) to MRT (its happening but not ready yet). One can feel a bit isolated out here.
There is a Indian temple in the neighbourhod, plenty of eateries, malls and shopping. Despite the above, It is worth the visit and I would return next time.",Date of stay: December 2019,,5,,,,,,,,Marine Parade,,

Rooms were clean, comfortable and cool. Room amenities and toiletries were very good and more than adequate.
Breakfast is at Baba Chew's, towards the main road. Good breakfast!
Cleaning staff were very efficient and thorough.
Location is in the East Coast....about 12-15 minutes from the airport. Unfortunately, it's not in the touristy/glitzy Orchard nor Marina area. Takes about another 12-15 minutes by cab to Orchard road or Chinatown. Lots of F & B outlets outside the hotel...around every corner and along the side streets.
It's priced in the mid range category and it's well worth it.
About a 10 minute walk towards the coastal highway there's a mall, Parkway Parade, and also a foodcourt nearby where we found some really good local chow!
Middle of one of our nights the air conditioner broke down and the night staff, duty manager and technicians were on hand to rectify! They tried and had no choice but to relocate us which was such a welcome. Thank you guys. Kudos to that team!

I particularly enjoyed the TWG tea and local sweets in the room, which were replenished throughout our stay. The design of the room was colorful but at the same time relaxing with its old-fashioned foot bath, cool mural, and geometric bathroom tiles.

Like much of Singapore, there's an awareness of the planet's need to go green, and a great green wall marks the entrance to the hotel.
There's an excellent ice cream shop just across the road, (Birds of Paradise), some great coffee (try Brawn & Brains), and some local designer clothing and accessories shops that are worth a visit. The hotel breakfast was OK, but seriously, you have a choice of excellent coffee and yummy food just outside your door so get adventurous!
There's a roof top pool, perfect to cool off at the end of the day, and the yoga class on Sunday morning, next to the pool, books up fast so let the reception know if you want to give it a go.

The thoughts put in for the small details in the room is very interesting. Especially when it was quite familiar to all of us.

But we were largely happy in Katong - a heritage area with much less foot hustle and bustle than Singapore central, with some interesting history, old architecture, temples and sights, and decent range of touristy and great value for money local cafes (off the main strip), bars, foot massage, shops etc all within very easy walking distance. Couldn't recommend Indigo and the staff there highly enough - we would definitely stay at the Indigo again, and will probably come back just to stay spend a few more days in Katong!",Date of stay: October 2019,,5,,,,,,,,Marine Parade,,
Hotel Indigo Singapore Katong,Tara,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Twigs2020,,Tara wrote a review Oct 2019,5 contributions,Hotel Indigo,"Absolutely loved this hotel I stayed here for 10 days and it was just 100%! Staff at reception were amazing all the time welcoming you back wishing you a good day when you went out or just saying hello. The little extra room touches were something I’ve not had before, the little foot spa, the complimentary sweets and pressed coffee. Also the decor was lovely the picture on the wall of the local areas and the size of the rooms is fantastic. I loved the fact the shower was on the opposite side of the room to the toilet.
This was my first time at Indigo and if I head back to Singapore I won’t be staying anywhere else. The swimming pool was amazing and the gym was well equipped but it’s best to walk down to east coast park and enjoy the outdoor running or cycling.",Date of stay: October 2019,,5,,,,,,,,Marine Parade,,

Excellent base to explore Singapore lots of great food outlets around for lunch or dinner. Breakfast options away from the hotel are limited but I think that is more that Singaporean’s don’t rise too early. There is a little Indian diner a few blocks walk which is open 24 hours very authentic but we had omelet and coffee two mornings in a row for $6.50 for two of us - great value.

The first thing you notice in the room is the mural on the wall and the colourful tiles in the bathroom. The second thing is the little touches: the Singaporean sweets, the tea and coffee, the foot bath and the toiletries box in the bathroom. All of this things are not at the expense of the basics: the bed was large and comfortable, the shower was spacious and had plenty of hot water, and there was a separate sitting area.
The breakfast at Baba Chews was included in the nightly rate and offered a great range in the buffet selection: fresh fruit, breads, pastries, cheese, meats, different juices, etc. This was in addition to unlimited choices from a hot breakfast menu that had changing daily specials. This set us up nicely for a day of exploring.
A friend who had grown up in the East Coast area warned us that we were staying too far out, but this quickly turned out not to be the case at all. There was a bus stop right outside the hotel with regular buses to the centre of the city. We had no trouble getting back between 10pm-midnight, though not sure what transport is like after that. An MRT card can be bought either from the hotel or from the 7/11 behind the bus stop. The latter is cheaper. The nearest MRT is about 20-30 minutes walk or a short bus journey away. Although a new MRT line is being built that will soon service the area.
We were out of the hotel most of the time as we were exploring the city. However, we made the effort to come back earlier on one night and take advantage of the rooftop pool. The view across Katong and into the city is great, especially as you're enjoying in the warm waters of the pool.
I'd happily stay again if I was back in Singapore and would recommend to anyone else.",Date of stay: September 2019,,5,,,,,,,,Marine Parade,,

A brand name that prides itself on taking on the influences of the local area. And in this case, the Katong area of Singapore. Although the charm of the area is slowly making way for modernization, the hotel's rooms are accentuated with decor that brings nostalgia back to the local staycationer. To the overseas tourist, a brief insight to the simpler days of old Singapore.
Room itself could not be faulted. Excellent shower and amenities, the toilet design was interesting, keeping the shower area and the toilet area separate (think opposite ends of the room). Bed was comfortable, minibar area was interesting. Carrom board for a coffee table? Genius.
Gym on the rooftop was well equipped and well stocked. Swimming pool has expansive views over Katong and Singapore. A great spot to hang out at night to get some thoughts in.
The check-in process leaves much to be desired, room was not ready by 3PM (whats the point of having a guaranteed check-in time?). But as this was a weekend stay, it is possible that staycaytioners all requested late check-outs. Although there was that hiccup, the stay would have been completely 5 stars if otherwise.
Breakfast the next morning at Baba Chews is an Buffet Ala-minute, with a fixed selection of dishes you can order as many times as you'd like. The Cold and bread buffet was there at all times, and rather slowly restocked (if at all). But it could be because we went for breakfast pretty late (930?).
Apart from the delayed check-in with no resolution or recovery, this property would have been 5 stars!",Date of stay: August 2019,,4,,,,,,,,Marine Parade,,

The rooftop infinity pool is a highly recommended place to relax and enjoy the stunning views.

Location of hotel is perfect, rooms are big, very nice, and make you feel at home, maybe better.
Staff is pro and able to satisfy requests in case of need.
Breakfast is generous, good quality, a pleasure!
Roofpool, is magic!
Few tips, for perfection, improve room setup, looks like the check list is not always used, once bathrobes were missing, same for foot care wipes. Both fixed very quickly.
Last point is some noises, but the responsibility of this is to be assigned to architects and builders that apparently did not use appropriate isolating materials. So you can listen voices from other rooms, and shower/toilet water of other rooms.
Apart this, fantastic.

The area: the hotel is relatively close to Changi (SGD15 taxi), in an interesting local area. It's a 15 minute walk to the beachside path, which has a very long walking/jogging path next to the shore. Plenty of great restaurants nearby.
Pluses: great rooftop pool - warm, with lovely views; the rooms are a good size, nice views and colourfully and interestingly furnished; very comfortable bed; very friendly and efficient staff; all in all a great, relaxing stay outside the usual tourist areas.
Minuses: very little really; most importantly, the hotel is not near the MRT, which means that you need to catch a bus (easy and close) or get a taxi to get to the usual tourist areas or to get to an MRT station; well priced given Singapore hotel prices.
Overall: we loved it, and after staying at many Singapore hotels, this is our favourite.",Date of stay: August 2019,,5,,,,,,,,Marine Parade,,

As an environmental preoccupied person, I found that the hotel has a green policy and you can earn points if you choose not to make up your room every day. For that you only need to hang the green sign on the outside of your door. I found out late about this policy but I feel everyone should know about this option from the first day.

You usually expect to know where the bed is, where to locate the table, the washroom etc . Here i need a while to orientate myself. We were placed at the 15th floor, so a high floor with good view. The service is very good, warm and welcoming . The location is right smack in Katong area. I have tried other hotels in the vicinity so i know I’m not going to be disappointed by the location and the food options here. Walking distance to east coast park for a morning run too . The only hiccup here is when we tried to request the delivery of a special amenity set to be delivered to our room. We were out when they tried to deliver the first time. I called and waited for about an hour and it never arrived.

This is important, or actually unimportant which is what I am trying to say when it comes to the Hotel Indigo. Located in Katong with its wide streets and low-rise development, much of it renovated shophouses from colonial times, the hotel benefits from the clean and relaxed open atmosphere, which it shares.
This is a new hotel refreshingly decorated in the public areas, and with very original layouts in the rooms. Unfortunately, we only stayed one night between Malaka and the airport ( a quick 14 klm drive away). We would have loved to stay longer ,and the next time we stop in Singapore this is where we will stay.
The rooms are large enough comfortable, well lit with light modern furniture and artwork on the wall. The toilet is discretely located and the cunningly designed bathroom actually located open to the view, but in a way that does not obscure the view from the sitting and sleeping area.

Once we'd relocated ourselves to the correct entrance we immediately knew we were in the better of the two options. The Peramakan style as you first walk in is evident throughout; rich in colour, shapes, and expressive design, this boutique hotel is best suited for those who seek something a little bit different.
The rooms are equally colourful and give you that WOW! factor as you walk in. Our room had a huge mural on the wall of a local scene as well as dark wooden floors and furniture, ornate tiling and a wicker chair in the bathroom area. The toilet had its own separate area, which was a great idea. It meant that we actually wanted to sit in the ""bathroom"" on the chair and stare out at the wonderful view of Katong.
The toiletries provided were all top notch (worth keeping if you don't use them all up). Slippers were provided too.
There was even enough room for a small sofa and coffee table. You're encouraged to look around because we only discovered just before we were leaving that the table actually concealed a board game that incorporated the table top. Such detail!
I had also arranged a birthday surprise for my partner when we arrived: a card, flowers, balloons, origami cranes (to make the towel swans), and some birthday sweet treats (all for only $50SG).
Make sure you allow yourself an hour or so by the pool on the roof. There's a great view of east Singapore from up there.
And be sure to explore the local area for yummy delights. Brunch at Brawn & Brains is worth a look if you're a coffee fiend.",Date of stay: July 2019,,5,,,,,,,,Marine Parade,,

The Indigo SIngapore Katong is no exception. The rooms are well kept and stylish, the staff tries to make everything possible they can to make the customer happy. They not only ask if everything was alright but also if there is anything they can make better - which I do not experience often in hotels. Also small details are taking care of, for example there is good coffee in the room (French press, not this instant coffee you often get with the american chain hotels).
The pool is really nice - you can have a proper swim there - it is definitely long enough for a good workout.
Katong / the area itself is very nice. There are lots of nice restaurants and bars within a few minutes walk. The East Coast Park is also close by for some time to relax or just have a walk / morning run.
The bus is leaving almost in front of the hotel and a Grab brings you into the inner city within 10 min for approx 8 SGD.
The price is reasonable for the value you get. Full recommendation",Date of stay: July 2019,,5,,,,,,,,Marine Parade,,

Gorgeous hotel with fantastic room amenities.
Bathroom and toilet were clean and toiletries given were lovely.
We booked the Premier room and I love the availability of the Nespresso machine.
Presence of the Hudson's and white rabbit sweets were so nostalgic.
The Good Morning towel and the Cha Kiak ( wooden clogs ) were such cool add ons.
I was so impressed by the room's decor that I booked a room for my wedding just so I can take gorgeous pictures as their theme matches my theme ( Peranakan! ).

Every single corner of the room, the restaurant, the lobby is instagramable 🤭
The bed was too comfy to get up in the morning 😆 The cleanliness is also spotless.
And - the - best - of - the - best - the bathroom with the view of the city 💯
Not forgetting the hotel restaurant that we had breakfast, Baba Chew, its Perakanan ambience was on point from the interior to the menu.And the service was excellent. Though we came almost last minute of breakfast operation, Annie was so welcoming and helpful to get us the orders ready in just a short time.This was the 3rd time we dined at Baba Chew, Annie and the team never failed to make us enjoy the experience.
Also the hotel was surrounded by a lot of shop-houses so you don't needa worry to get bored and hungry...

The staff were extremely attentive and knowledgeable. Our room was gorgeous and clean and no attention to detail had been missed. The rooftop pool was a perfect spot to relax after a long day exploring Singapore. With that said we spent a majority of our money there paying for taxis. There is no subway nearby yet and so in order to get to Marina Bay, Chinatown and most hawkers a taxi is the only way to do it. Although Katong the neighborhood is a really neat spot to walk around and has plenty of great restaurants I wish the hotel could have been in a more walkable area.",Date of stay: July 2019,,4,,,,,,,,Marine Parade,,

The hotel staff are amazing so friendly and helpful , always welcoming with a smile and a greeting. The staff in the morning at breakfast always made a great start to my day there is a great choice of food to choose from .
My room on floor 14 had a great view over Katong the decoration was a blend of old with modern touches very comfortable bed
Very roomy shower just remember to close the curtain 😀
My room was cleaned every day I did opt not to have the bedding changed every day
A good choice of complimentary tea and coffee .
Roof top pool area is a great place to watch the sun set and the pool looked very inviting even thought I didn’t use it as always back late

The location is not near a traditional famous area of Singapore. But, the neighborhood is quite nice with quite a lot dinning options.
Hotel staff is really helpful. They help me to adjust the room rate from my cooperate 1 person stay rate to 2 adults and 1 child rate. The price is quite reasonable.
We flew in on a midnight flight and arrived at hotel lobby at 8am. Folks in lobby is very helpful to complete all check-in process and help us take care of luggage before we can check-in the room at night.
Hotel decoration has very genuine local style. The layout is quite specially but acceptable. Room is not large but enough. Quite many nice stuff displayed in the closet. They gave local sweeties for free, which is really a plus.
We also like the pool on the top. It is a infinity pool. Not large nor fancy. But, you can have a nice view of that area. It is still delightful.
Another thing i have to share is the breakfast. The breakfast is offered in the restaurant nearby. Don't worried. It is just next to the lobby. They have set manu with lots of selections and everyday specials and a small buffet with bread, fruits, juice and some other cold dishes. We do love the Kaya toast and almost ordered it everyday.
I do think Indigo Katong is really a good choice and worth every penny you spend there",Date of stay: October 2018,,5,,,,,,,,Marine Parade,,

One of the perks of this hotel was definitely their roof-top pool, which gives you an outstanding view over the area. When it comes to the food, it is out of this world, so delicious and tasty.

It’s about 15/20 mins from the airport, very quiet but in a great area with lots of bars/restaurants close by.
We walked over to the beach/park on the coast in no time at all. Bus stops nearby, only downside is that it’s about 12min walk to a metro, didn’t bother us at all because the area is so nice.

I know now why all my friends were giving me the you-are-gonna-to-be-impressed + wow look. It was like stepping into some kind of hybrid lavish hotel museum when I arrived into the lobby. And after I checked in, the feeling of just walking into another hotel room did not transpired. Instead, I thought I walked into a love making movie set made for the Peranakan 60s in Singapore. They make you step back in time, the décor and the details. I was immediately embraced by a heavy coat of nostalgia. That red wooden Chinese clogs placed by the door, that same rustic red metal toilet pan I used to have under my childhood bed, I paused and stood still. I let memories of old played like faded flashcards through my mind. The sound of clogs that reverberated the night air as I walked the concrete floor to the toilet from my childhood room. Speechless, I was in an emotional transient between now and the past. After I came back from my much younger days, I set about unpacking and organizing my stuffs. That’s when I realized, to wash my backside after I visit the toilet, I have to walk across the bedroom hoping nothing I missed wiping that clings to me butt will drop on the floor. The shower is right in the other end of the long room by the window. But the business end of the toilet next to the entrance, is separated by that one continent of a bed. This is indeed a strange design. Then, I found no desk to work, and realized the few electrical sockets located by a low sentimental carrom board means it’s a work table. The work chair is a sofa. All these are situated in the small space between the bed and the toilet. For 5 days, my work on my notebook was towards the torturous side. I guess this is not really meant for a business stay unless you really have no work to do after office hours. Hunger in the evening is not going to be a problem. On the main road and opposite, is one notorious famous Singapore Laksa. The smooth rice noddle in rich curry like soup, a must if you have not tried before. Adjacent and everywhere else, plenty of local eats to choose from. There are also the western venues, if you have not adapted to Asian taste. Beer, whisky & wine are not too far away either. I did no breakfast in the hotel, so I could not give a rating to that. But I had hearty meals in the mornings, 10 minutes’ walk away, over at the hawker next to Parkway Parade. Parkway is a big shopping mall that had been around for decades, further fueling my nostalgia. Yes, Indigo may not be in the middle of town basking in bustle, not near to an MRT for convenience nor next to the CBD. But, the diversity of its surroundings, plus it was really easy for me to GRAB to and from here, makes it a really fantastic hotel to stay. Location is just great and if budget is your constraint, another IHG hotel, Holiday Inn Express is just next door to this. I like Indigo, but that one star to full rating is that missing proper desk and chair I needed always for my stays.",Date of stay: May 2019,,4,,,,,,,,Marine Parade,,

When I first wrote an email to the front office, I wasn't being entertained until I emailed again, saying that I hope to leave a good review, then I received replies from Faris, the Acting Neighbourhood Host. I was very pleased with the arrangement in all our email thread for the past 1 week before my stay in Hotel Indigo.
I arranged a courier to send the ""HAPPY BIRTHDAY"" banner with tape to the front desk and had them to decorate it for me by the window.
Upon arriving at my room, I saw that the banner was down, and with such a big tape that I gave it to them, they actually only used a small piece to secure the banner which was a HUGE disappointment because I was expecting it to be up. I don't understand why I gave a BIG tape but Hotel Indigo Staff only cut a tiny piece to secure it!
Next is the sliced cake which was told that they would send it up to me upon check-in as I requested for it, and I specifically mentioned that I do not want them to send after evening as I won't be around in the room. Before I leave my hotel room, I did not receive any slice of cake and was thinking maybe after I return back to my room I would have seen it. But yet again, NONE was seen.
Overall, the stay was great because we had the last room and no one to disturb us. But the disappointment I had was the birthday banner as well as the cake which never appear.. I believe Faris would have done a better job if he/she were there to assist me.

We loved the design of the rooms, and enjoyed the nice big rooftop pool on a hot afternoon. Another thing that really stood out was the breakfast - outstanding!
Katong is a wonderful area of Singapore and definitely worth being considered a base for a couple of days while in this amazing city. Lots of wonderful restaurants around, and the best Laksa in SG!!",Date of stay: April 2019,,5,,,,,,,,Marine Parade,,

Location is vibrant and full of options ranging from coffee to fine dining. Location is safe..as is all of Singapore. Close proximity to airport and central..without being in those congested, busy areas is awesome.
Rooms are small, but efficient and beautifully decorated in local design. Rooms are quiet and it seems the hotel soundproofed the walls well. Shower water pressure is perfect! Perks like a foot soaking bath are unexpected, and welcome after a long days work or was long through Singapore.
Bed was comfortable and bedding was soft. Towels were thick and absorbent and bath amenities were large sized and smelled great.

True to their philosophy, Hotel Indigo is not only situated in a culturally rich Katong locality, it has adopted the local Peranakan culture as it’s theme for this property.
Katong locality used to be a sea-side residential area until mid-20th century, which had a unique & rich blend of cultural mix of Malay, Chinese & Europeans. It used to be a wealthy suburb which allowed fishermen families to co-exist and that reflected two sides of the society in a unique blend, until the time when Singapore’s growth started taking shape. In this cultural mix, one of the dominant culture was Peranakan culture and that’s what reflects even in modern day Katong, today. Hotel Indigo has done a fantastic job in reflecting the great cultural heritage of Peranakans, in its Katong property.
The overall decor, right from the entrance of the hotel, has reflection of this culture and finds its way, right upto the guest rooms. Be it the artefacts kept in lobby, art work in the corridor, the floor tiles, or having a vertical landscape right at the hotel entrance. My personal favourite – the art work done in the guest room’s main wall, that depicts the rich culture from the past and we can get to see a glimpse of this culture in few other cities in Malaysia. The interiors in the property has a rich color palette, that goes well with the overall decor. In the midst of cultural reflection, all the modern amenities have been well taken care and that makes the guest rooms very impressive and welcoming!
Noteworthy – the property has an excellent rooftop infinity pool with a well-equipped fitness centre. Also, it has one of the best dining options in Katong, in the form of its in-house Bar & Restaurant called ‘Baba Chews’ which is an all-day dining option. This restaurant is situated in a heritage building, which was the former Joo Chiat police station and the place has been structurally kept intact, straight from the pages of history!
Best part of this property is its location. While you get a chance to stay in the heart of Katong, another major attraction of Singapore – the East Coast Park(ECP) is just a short-walk away. So too Marine Parade locality with just few minutes walk. Certainly you can’t ask for more, be it your business travel or for leisure. Enjoy every bit of your stay!!",Date of stay: March 2019,,5,,,,,,,,Marine Parade,,

The decor from the foyer to the rooms is amazing colours and design unique and it is easy to see that the Katong area much of which is peranekan is reflected in the decor.
Now for the important bit, check in one of the best we have had if I recall correctly Shakeel did our check in, during our stay Jennifer who worked in reception was amazing with her customer service.
Our room was large and modern we were on the 13th floor and had views across Katong. The toilet was separate to the bathroom, the bathroom itself was unique with bright design and importantly immaculate, the shower had a rain shower and the size of the shower cubicle was really large, good hot water and soft towels and the botanicals range of toiletries was excellent.
Our room had a king bed which was so comfortable and ensured excellent sleep quality.
The room had a seating area with table which was great to sit and enjoy a tea or coffee.
Capsule coffee and plunger coffee was included, a really nice touch to the mini bar area was three lolly jars with traditional lollies to enjoy and also a little bit of history about the lollies.
Breakfast was in the Baba Chews restaurant ,the decor here was really nice. Up front have to say they do great coffee here,breakfast excellent plenty of cold assortments cereals yoghurt fruit, juices and cheeses and the hot food choices from the menu included several peranakan Malay/Singapore dishes and also traditional breakfasts bacon eggs, omeletes etc.Baba Chews is open from breakfast time through to late evening and they serve meals and snacks all day or you could go for a drink in the bar there.

Went to the room and it was beautifully decorated as with my request to add on roses/cards/snacks/balloons to surprise my wife. The room itself is unique and well thought off. Can see the pride the hotel takes for the rooms. And I like the attention they give to the minor details like having a DIY ""free"" foot spa as part of the theme.
You can walk around the vicinities of the hotel to help yourself to a range of food or massages if you like.

I liked the candy selection from the hotel in the vitrine of the room. I also took some home :) The restaurants and supermarkets are near by.
We spent only 4 days there, but it is just a lovely place to stay if you are on a business trip. The airport is very close and the offices in the center are about 25-30 min taxi drive.",Date of stay: January 2019,,5,,,,,,,,Marine Parade,,

Hotel Indigo Singapore Katong,James W,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/G3169EFjamesw,"Hong Kong, China",James W wrote a review Feb 2019,253 contributions,Quirky boutique hotel that checks the boxes,"The Katong neighborhood on the East Coast of Singapore is not easy to get to. A 10 minute ride from Changi Airport, it's not exactly close to the subway, and taxis are not as frequent as in the city center. But if you like heritage, this hotel is built on top of the bones of the old local police station.
The neighborhood is Peranakan---that is, immigrant Chinese/Malay, like from way back. The storefronts and architecture are reminiscent of Singapore 50 years ago.
The rooms in the old Police Stations (Floor 7 and below) reflect the antique heritage. Like either an old police dormitory or else prisoner cell, the rooms have no desks. The coffee table is an old Bangqi (Chinese pool) table. The bathroom sink is a converted sewing machine footpedal stand. And the chairs are an eclectic mix of wire rattan, stuffed furniture and wooden pieces. The bed was comfortable, and the room temperature control actually worked. So the room stayed cool during the hot Singapore day time. There are just enough plugs.
The bathroom was interesting. There was a toilet with an old fashion shower fawcett on the side. You don't eve see those in rural China anymore. And I think it's more for show than for actual use. There is a separate washing area and shower that overlooks the street.
The service was present but invisible. I hardly saw anyone but the two front desk staff. And while this is a very family friendly hotel. I was there with mostly other male business people.
Two quibbles: There was a mouse/rat scratching through the walls. And the hotel entrance is very easily confused with the Holiday Inn Express next door. The Indigo is the older heritage boutique from floor 7 down. The Holiday Inn Express is the modern building from floor 7 upwards.
Heritage, check. Recycling furniture, check. Eco-conservation, check. Peranakan neighborhood, check.",Date of stay: January 2019,,4,,,,,,,,Marine Parade,,

I wanted a hotel in the east side of Singapore so that I could explore the area. While not near a MRT station, there are many buses available which brings you to the city centre. Hence, I would say it is quite convenient. Service wise is very friendly, and good internet connection. The hotel design is Peranakan style, which is a nod towards the Peranakan roots of this area. The room itself has some accents like the easy chair, wooden clogs, which is quite cute. However, the design of the room is slightly inconvenient. Firstly, the toilet is separate from the shower area and located right next to the entrance of the room. Also, the shower has huge window panes which faces the garden. While you can pull down the blinds and curtains, there are still gaps which you need to be careful of. The towel rack is quite far from the shower, so you need to walk out a few steps (dripping everywhere) to get it. Small little things like that make a huge difference. We went to the infinity pool on the roof top. It is quite small, but offers a view of the east side.
Katong area is quite laid back and loads of food choices within proximity of the hotel.",Date of stay: December 2018,,4,,,,,,,,Marine Parade,,

I have been to Singapore many a times and I have never ventured out this far east but I am so glad I did this time around as I am in love with this property, especially the neighbourhood.
This amazing hotel represents both modern and traditional design concepts. The colonial rooms mimics the local culture and the amazing design of the buildings that lined the streets just facing the property. Our rooms were very spacious and it has a bathroom and a half which was very convenient. The outdoor infinity pool overlooks the colourful and magical neighborhood.
Next to Intercontinental Hotels, Indigo Properties are my second favourite accommodation when traveling as they showcase and represent the culture and traditions and heritage of the local area where they are located.

Hotel Indigo Singapore Katong,Mich R,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/michmutters,"Adelaide, Australia",Mich R wrote a review Jan 2019,57 contributions,A Unique Hotel With A Local Flavour,"Pros:
1) This hotel is situated in the suburb of Katong, which between the city centre and the airport. Katong is a traditional stronghold of the Peranakan culture. Right opposite the hotel is a row of shops with architecture from the turn of the 20th century.
2) There are many restaurants are bars as well as a small shopping mall with a supermarket within 5 minutes walk. However, on the other side of the hotel, in Marine Parade, you will find Parkway Parade - a larger shopping mall with everything.
3) Transport, as always in Singapore, is convenient. Taxis are cheap and depending on the traffic, it’s not a long ride into Orchard Road.
4) The rooms are extremely unique though not large. The rooms are designed to reflect the Peranakan culture of Katong. Little touches like the coffee cups, the furnishings and how the amenities are stored are specific to that culture and a time period.
5) There is a floor to ceiling window in the dressing area and shower; the toilet is located separately.
6) The murals in the room make the rooms unique instead of the standard, bland and uninteresting framed prints.
7) They serve a semi-buffet breakfast every morning - other than what is on offer in buffet style (cold cuts, breads, juices, pastries, local breakfast delicacies), there is a Full breakfast menu which includes the chef’s local favourites as well as the standard cafe breakfast - eggs etc. I highly recommend the noodle bar in the corner where a fresh bowl of noodle soup can be made. It may sound odd to have hot, clear soup in the morning for breakfast in a tropical country - but it’s actually quite cleansing! I loved all of the freshly squeezed juices in the fridge.
6) Each room comes with a Nespresso machine which is really good so you can clear travel fog before going down for breakfast. Bottled water is free.
7) The infinity pool is quite generous for a hotel this size. The gym is well equipped and everything is really clean in there.
Cons:
1) The rooms are small so cots are not available if you have an older child or young teenager.
2) For half of the stay, our room was not cleaned properly. Hair was still on the floor in the toilet (where we had to dry our hair as the appropriate plug was missing from the dressing area). Hair was also on the floor in the dressing area. The wrong amenities were provided ie we received 2 conditioners instead of a shampoo and conditioner.
3) The shower area can be slippery when you step into it. I don’t think the tiles are non-slip. Older guests should be mindful.
4) The floor-to-ceiling window - do not forget to shut the blinds before showering.
5) The only window in the room are the large windows in the dressing and shower area. It means you get a spectacular view which you can enjoy whilst Not showering.
6) The hotel restaurant is not large so it gets busy during breakfast. I think they use inexperienced staff so service can be very slow during breakfast.
7) Pool side tables were not clear of the remnants of other people’s meals.
Generally the staff are very well-trained (except for some of the morning breakfast service staff), helpful and obliging.",Date of stay: November 2018,,3,,,,,,,,Marine Parade,,

As a hotel chain, I definitely think they are one of the best - and this new hotel in Katong is also fab!
If you’re tired of generic ‘white box executive’ hotels - This is the place for you!
I LOVE the colourful decor and interesting rooms.
We had a standard room which was still fabulous - with amazing floor to ceiling windows high above the local skyline, a great show, comfy bed, big TV with English language channels, good tea and coffee in the room, and a lovely couch area.
Staff were very friendly and presented us with fruits and sweets upon check in - a lovely and most welcome touch. :)
Also in the rooms there was a stool, decorated tub, and a kit with instructions for providing a foot bath / scrub - which was fantastic after a long day of walking!! I haven’t seen that before and it was amazing! Definitely have it if you can convince your partner / kids to do it on you! :)
There’s only 3 slight negatives / areas for improvement:
1) the location - it’s quite a walk in the heat to the nearest Metro station, so be prepared for that or get a cab. Despite this, Katong is a lovely area to walk around and get a feel for the ‘real Singapore’ - away from the tourist traps.
2) The rooftop pool is lovely - but too cold!! I couldn’t even get in it one day as the wind was blowing and the water was like ice! They really, really need to heat the pool. It’s such a shame as I love swimming, and the pool was one of the main reasons we chose this hotel.
3) Breakfast needs improving. The coffee is decent, the fruit and yoghurt is good, but the savoury options weren’t great, especially the roti and chicken curry special - which was small and had only very fatty meat swimming in an oily curry sauce. Not nice.
Also, it was carnage the second morning of our stay - not enough staff as the restaurant was full. There were also a lot of kids screaming and running around which the staff didn’t try to control in any way. That was disappointing as yes, I get it, kids are loud, but these ones were rude, pushing in and taking all of the good food from the buffet as soon as it was set down (which I’m sure they didn’t eat) which was very frustrating for those of us trying to have a relaxing breakfast.
Apart from those three issues I would stay again - so I hope these things can be improved for our next visit.",Date of stay: January 2019,,4,,,,,,,,Marine Parade,,

Room: 5 of 5 balls
The room has an interesting theme unlike most bigger hotel chains, with the bath and toilet area covered with “flowery baroque style” tiles. The room is filled with colours, from the monochrome background to the colourful sofa and carpet. It might look like a colour explosion to some, but it was definitely delightful to me and my wife.
Location: 4.5 of 5 balls
It’s not central where it’s near attractions, but the Katong neighbourhood, the nearby food and East Coast Park offers something a different respite.
Bathtub: 5 of 5 balls
This warrants a separate rating on its own. It’s a big off-white tub capable of letting 2 slim adults in. The outer part of the tub itself has carvings that suit the bathroom tiles. It was simply marvellous to soak in the tub with a splendid view of the neighbourhood. The tub was simple to operate.
Breakfast: 4.5 of 5 balls
We had breakfast at Baba Chews both mornings. The restaurant theme and design followed the hotel, with local delights and about 5 fixed items of eggs and waffles. There was prata with chicken curry on 1 day and laksa on another. The taste was an adequate replacement of what we would usually have (do try out local eateries which are popular for these items though). The egg choices were decent and serving large. I had eggs benedict on the 2nd morning and besides being delicious, it came with toast and mushrooms too.
They also have a small buffet area serving cold items and juices, some freshly squeezed. The food definitely scored with me.
Only downside was that the service could use some brushing up. While the staff were friendly, they tend to miss out things here and there, for example sitting you down but not passing you the menu etc. I understand this is relatively small issues but we tried for more than 5 mins to get their attention on the 1st morning before a staff came to us with the menu.
Overall: 5 of 5 balls
I really love the room, bathtub and breakfast enough to warrant a return. My only negative factor of the hotel is the size of the pool. Yes its on the rooftop and its an infinity pool. However it’s too small for a swim, its more like a big cold tub for you to soak in or for kids to play in. But still the pool is not a damper enough to deter considerations for a return visit.",Date of stay: December 2018,,5,,,,,,,,Marine Parade,,

Hotel Indigo Singapore Katong,OneDarren,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/OneDarren,Singapore,OneDarren wrote a review Dec 2018,8 contributions,Stay at this hotel. Please?,"Let me first start by telling you how I found this hotel. On trip advisor, I sort hotels in Singapore by review rating. Then I sieve out those that are above SG$300. Voila. There she is, Hotel Indigo. Affordable, yet highly rated. If it wasn't for its size, it'd probably beat out large expensive hotels in fame. I haven't stayed in many hotels, but I've stayed at enough to know quality. THIS hotel, my friends, deserves your stay.
The hotel itself looks new, both inside and out. Everything is shiny and clean, but it's a little small.
Service is excellent. Check in and out, room service, extra requests. All were met with efficiency and quality. How much ARE you paying your staff for such quality Hotel Indigo? And yet the rooms are affordable?! Impossible. Yet here we are.
The rooms themselves are amazing. The taste that the design philosophy leaves in your mouth is subjective, but you cannot deny that the rooms are new, clean, the beds extremely comfortable, has more than appropriate amenities and appliances, and to top it all off, the rooms are BIG for its price might I add. But here comes the first few gripes: the air-conditioning is wonky. Sometimes I think that the control doesn't matter at all. I set it to the lowest setting and it doesn't seem to make a difference within an hour. But a few hours later it's freezing. Sometimes the service phone in the room doesn't work either. Then there's the proximity sensor that detects your presence in the room and turns the lights on. Sometimes it doesn't work immediately. I had to wave for a good minute for it to start working. But all those are just minor gripes, they might take a tenth of a point off outta 10 for me.
The amenities in the hotel itself are more than satisfactory. The gym is large for the hotel's size, the pool is large as well. Both are clean, new and modern. Towels, water, even tissues are provided.
Then comes the food. The food from the room service is excellent. Well, it depends. I've had varied experiences. Most orders came within half an hour and tasted delicious, but some didn't taste as well. I can't remember what they were, but the Fried Kway Teow and Chicken Rice were always awesome. Breakfast was awesome as well. A unique blend of buffet/ ordering from the menu. The food is delicious, BUT service is slow on weekends. I see 3 staff taking orders for 30 tables, or more. They'd mess my orders up or forget the fork I asked for 3 times. I have no fault with their service attitude, but you have GOT to hire more people to man the breakfast buffet Hotel Indigo.
The location isn't bad. It has entertainment around it, and food, but it's located away from the city. If you are going to the city often, it'd take 30 minutes by car, or much longer by public transport. However, if it's a short stay, a.k.a. a layover, the hotel is close to the airport, and should be convenient.
Overall, you are NEVER going to get this quality at this price point at ANY other hotel in Singapore. Period. It's deserving of a price point that is twice as high. (But please don't raise it IHS, I'd be hard pressed to stay here again, and I really want to.)",Date of stay: June 2018,,5,,,,,,,,Marine Parade,,

The hotel was tastefully decorated and furnished, from the hotel lobby to the room. The focus on the Peranakan culture was just nice. The only downside is that the entrance to the hotel lobby could be easily missed as it is “hidden” from the main road. The room was cosy and had a pair of clogs and carrom table. The toilet had a few “vintage” items like a plastic string chair, complimentary White Rabbit Hard candy sweets and the basin converted from a Singer sewing machine which added to the charm. The infinity pool overlooks the Katong neighbourhood. The day and night views were amazing! The restaurant, Baba Chew, serves pretty authentic Peranakan food too.

The excellent service, hospitality, hygiene and comfort are major reasons why I returned repeatedly.
As we know, the month of December is often the peak period of travels. As such, it is inevitable that the hotel has high occupancy and miscommunication may occur every now and then.
However, the hotel staff were quick in rectifying the problem with outstanding professionalism and service. In particular, Hidayah rendered her utmost support and assistance at the front desk, facilitating the quick resolution to the issue. I was definitely impressed by how the issue was resolved, and definitely how positive the customer service was maintained and how they really show how every guest is their priority all the time.
Furthermore, the duty manager, Esther, made a courtesy call to explain more about the issue. It was a heartwarming conversation.

I stayed here for 5 days with my husband and thoroughly enjoyed my stay. The location is very convenient as there are bus-stops within less than 50 meters! There is a taxi stand in the mall next to the hotel (I12 Katong). Also there are plenty of hip eating joints to suit every taste bud and pocket! Lots of shopping options too!
The rooms are large and differently designed, toilet and bathing areas are separate. It is very tastefully decorated and is very clean as it is new and hope that it stays this way. The swimming pool area is large and I loved it ..nice views, lots of breeze and was very relaxing. The staff was always very cheerful and helpful. The rooms are cleaned once a day, on the first day we had an extremely good cleaner while the cleaning service was not very good on the remaining days.They allowed us to check in a little early at around 11.50 hr, though we had to pay half day rent to check out late at 6 PM. The breakfast was big and sumptuous with daily different local specialities too! ..also there were enough choices for vegetarians! The wifi was free and very good.

The hotel met all of our expectations. Staff were great throughout our stay, the room spacious and lovely decorated, the bed comfortable.
Everyone was not only efficient (the way you would expect it to be in Singapore) but welcoming and attentive.
We had a nice room on the 13th floor and were surprised by it’s big size (considering how much of a premium space is in a city like Singapore). Furthermore, they really did a good job blending in the traditional Perankan heritage style into the room’s modern comfort.
The complimentary mobile phone provided came more than handy as it made navigation around the city very easy if you don’t have any local data.
The Indigo might not be cheap if on a travel budget but certainly is great value for money compared to other Singapore hotels.
Though not directly connected by a MRT station we liked the hotel‘s location in the traditional area of Katong between Changi Airport and the city centre. There are different busses taking you into the city, a Grab from Changi Airport is 15S$, to the city as low as 12S$.
In general breakfast was good in terms of selection, generosity and quality.

All rooms are identical, some facing the city view and Katong historical houses.
This hotel and its rooms are all about embedding you in the local history, culture and architecture, more than being just ""another hotel"". Rooms are filled with colourful and funky furniture, even an old closet filled with antique China and pictures from the nearby historical houses are all over the hotel walls. The hotel theme is clear.
The rooms are build like the Chinese traditional houses in Singapore, narrow and long, no worries there is plenty space, but it has indeed an interesting design, with all the spaces being one after the other, and instead of a regular wall and window at the end of the room, there's a gigantic floor to ceiling and wall to wall set of windows, giving over the entire city state.
You 'll find a Nespresso coffee machine in the room and jarres filled with local candies. The toiletries are from a niche brand, adding to the feeling of boutiqueness of this hotel.
On the roof top you'll find a magnificent infinity pool and the gym.
The hotel location is about 15 mns drive from the airport and the same to the center (Orchard or Bugis). A good base if you want to stay in a more vibrant hood than the center. Streets are lined with restaurant and some bars and there's enough to see for a full day in Katong.
My room (1209) was located on the 12th floor, and had the same size as the others.
I stayed 1 night and paid a hefty 160 euros. The week before I paid slightly more to be set at the plush and more centric Intercontinental (same hotel chain). But if you want to be in a dynamic and different location, come to indigo Katong. Staff was young and at the image of the venue, friendly service focused and knowledgeable.

Special shout out to Sy from Concierge (immaculate personalized service, always excited to see friendly dedicated staff like her) - thank you for the birthday arrangement!
Another special shoutout to Melt breakfast team! I wanted some leafy vegetables that was not on the menu, a simple question and the attendant got me a caesar salad! How flexible is this Unfortunately I didnt get his name. To the male attendant in red shirt taking care of the alfresco area on 13 Nov morning - thank you for going the extra mile!
Lastly, kudos to the pool crew! The crew will prepare/setup the sunbed for each individual guest ensuring a seat for all. Love their attentiveness! Also my friend injured her leg in the pool and Stalin (Lifeguard) attended to her wounds professionally. He even remembered us the next day and gave us advices on how to take care of the wound. Thank you for asking!
As with all other hotels, pool timings are limited to 2 hours and pre-booking of facilities are required. Although with limited usage of the facilities, the restrictions are necessary, it gives us the reassurance to have fun while staying safe!
All in all, the stay at MO was so memorable that we started making plans for our next staycation next month (received a return voucher yay!).

I still believe that it's all in the staff that makes MO have that signature type of service that they provide. Kudos to Andrew (From PH) of Front Desk who first welcome us. Second, to the Melt Cafe staff Ganesan and Faisal..Ganesan very funny and friendly while Faisal is really a hardworking lad but always smiling and really interacts with people imagine we saw him in Melt for dinner then early morning we saw him again then lunch saw him in Dolce Vita wow he is all around! Also Melo (PH Guy) from Dolce Vita he took nice pics when he saw us on the poolside he offered right away very nice and friendly also. Next is the witty Mischaelle (from PH)from MO bar she knows all the drinks and will suggest what suits you best! Most of their Filipino Staff are very friendly no doubt about it also shoutout to Marie of Melt Cafe :) and lastly the one who helped us to look for our cab from the lobby greeter staff Mr Chan he is very friendly and always smiling even if its hot outside. We love the Epicurean Escapade deal and we will be back again that's for sure. Very clean hotel and organized and the pool with amazing view and food was fantastic in all their restos plus dont skip MO Bar pls order the Harvest Queen Signature Peacock drink! Lovely drink! Oh before i end this review, thank you also to Jeanette Ho from Reservations Dept i havent seen her but she is the one who patiently answers all my inquiries via email! By the way we lost our Rotterdam Signature Tumbler which we left in the gym and Princess (from PH again) of Reservations helped us to find the lost item and was able to give it to us right away.

We stayed at the Marina Bay View Room on the highest floor (21st) and had the most spectacular views. The service was excellent right from check in to the time we checked out. Hotel was super clean and ambience was great. I have to say that this is by far the best hotel stays I've had.
I could tell that the hotel staff was always finding out ways to wow their guests and make our experience even better than it already was. They were super attentive and paid attention to the smallest details. Although the staff who helped me with my reservation was not working on the 3 days I was there, she had made sure that the room was decorated with balloons and even had a special box of chocolates waiting for us with a welcome card. They even sent me an anti slip mat for the bathroom right after check in although I did not request for it. So special mention to Nancy, Thank you.
The breakfast service at the Melt cafe was simply exceptional. They did not have any green fresh vegetable juices but went out of their way to prepare a glass for me simply because I asked if they had any. The restaurant manager came up to me to offer a cushion for my back without me even requesting for it because he realised I was pregnant. Special mention to Muven, who helped us with our halal breakfast request. He had the chef especially fry the chicken for us in a separate wok because of our dietary requirements.
The staff at the gym was amazing too. My husband had come back from his run and went straight to the gym. He was immediately offered a new mask since the one he was wearing might be damp from the sweat. Right after working on the weights, the staff asked if he needed some bottled water to hydrate himself.
It's these things that truly differentiate a 5 star service hotel vs a 5 star hotel.

The Food at Melt was excellence too. My simple suggestions is may be can give a little of your fine hot sauce in a little bowl so we can add more juicy taste on main course - the Beef Cheek / Chicken and Fish too.
Your M & E services is real fast upon attending to a loose towel rack loosen and fix it promptly that's testimonial of Oriental branding.

Despite we are staying in for the weekend, we managed to get our rooms at 12PM without any signs of queues and was given a late-check out of 2PM. On the next morning, we made a casual request if we could stay a lil longer if possible and they kindly gave us a 4PM late-check out, which many hotels couldn't do even if you have elite status. The rooms are not the best design or quality to be honest, as some of the design is a lil dated and it is a pity that the TV still requires HDMI (which they gave one to every room btw so that's not too bad actually) and no nespresso machine. But I think the view, the luxury and the service (imo one of the best in Singapore) makes up the weak points . Rest assured…",Date of stay: November 2020,,5,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

The room was clean and our room had a great view of the flyer and MBS.
I loved that pool time is strictly kept to 2 hours and you had to book ahead. This mean no overcrowding and we managed to snag a pod to laze by the afternoon sun.
Dinner at Melt - the food was befitting of their reputation, but we suspect most people were there with the promo, hence the staff were rather overwhelmed. Our bread came after appetizers were served and it was cold. However let that not takeaway the meal, which was a delight in itself.

We managed to check in one of the room(room 1538) at 1.30pm and was notified that the other room wasn't available yet. We waited patiently in room 1538 but decided to call the Duty Manager at 4.30pm to check whether the other room is ready. After waited for more than 30 minutes and received no response from the Manager, I decided to visit the front office check-in counter personally instead. Managed to speak to the Manager Ian and it was already at 5pm and yet we were informed by him that the room is still not ready. I reminded him that even though we paid for the MO staycation package and the check in time is 12pm(upon availability), however we did not expect for early check-in but just hope to be able to check in at normal time at 3pm. But in our case, our room is still not available until 5pm. And the red wine that we have chosen as a MO member wasn't delivered despite several reminders. Finally Ian personally brought up the room key(room 1532) as well as the wine to us at around 5.15pm. He apologised and granted us for late check out until 6pm on the next day as well as a S$100 room credit. A good gestures but more to come.
While we enjoyed and relaxed at the pool in the evening at around 6.30pm, we received a call from our daughter that the room key at 1532 that collected at 5.15pm wasn't working. She rushed up and down to/from the reception and yet she still not able to open the door. And no one is accompanied her to check why she couldn't open the door despite she has spent more than 15 minutes up and down. No choice but my husband left the pool with his swimming attire and met my daughter at the reception to see Ian again. After checking, noticed that the door battery was flat that's resulted why my daughter couldn't open the door. But the help only reached us after 30 minutes. What a hectic day!
For dinner, We decided to order in-room dining. We placed the order at 8.20pm and the food supposed to be delivered to us at 9.10pm. However, when the food did not arrive until 9.15pm, I have decided to call the in-room dining team. I was surprised to hear that one of the sandwich that we have ordered is wholemeal bread but the chef accidentally prepared as white bread hence they couldn't send the rest of our food. I was really shocked why the team did not call us to check but to hold on to our food until we called them. If only we didn't call the team, think we can only have our dinner at 10pm. Of course, in order not to delay any further, white bread is not a problem for us and also paid for the white bread sandwich.
Upon check out, noticed that our spa credit of $200 and the MO member food credit of $130 (for 2 rooms) wasn't credited to our bills. IF only i didn't check the bills we have to folk out extra $330 for the spa and food. And of course, the check-out was delayed due to the checking. I seriously shocked that a 5 stars hotel like Mandarin Oriental has such lousy quality of service.
Upon arrival back home, I suddenly remember that the MO staycation comes with sparkling wine per room. But both of our rooms did not have any sparking wine. I have messaged Ian the Manager regarding the sparking wine however i did not receive his response regarding the wines until today. I guess we paid for the MO staycation package and we are entitled to it right? At least an apologies from the hotel on the oversight.
This is a first 5 stars hotel that we have stayed and received no survey/review after check-out. I have requested for the survey/review to be sent to my email and until today I have not received it. Was the review/survey purposely made not to send to my email so that I wouldn't share my bad experience? I hope with a brand like MO would take the feedbacks as a constructive feedbacks and strives to provide better quality service.",Date of stay: October 2020,,1,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

Signing up for fans of MO also gave us 2 free drinks with our meal so I recommend that. Facilities were by reservation only so nothing was too crowded, felt quite safe as there was more than enough space for everyone to distance themselves.

Last 22-23 October, my friend and I stayed in MO to rest from the busyness of work, and we loved it there! The service is superb and the people are extremely friendly. They are attentive to our needs and are always ready to offer their assistance.
We were welcomed by friendly staff upon entering, and ushered with smiles to the concierge area. We were handed messages and announcements about they efforts to ensure a safe stay for us despite the pandemic. Their assurance of maintaining cleanliness in the hotel gave us peace of mind. We appreciated the handwritten welcome letter too, which made us feel special and warmly welcomed.
Breakfast was fabulous! Their servers are very hands-on and always around. We didn’t have to wait long until they come to assist us. They accommodated to our requests and even prepared a gluten-free pancake for my friend from scratch! (A for effort!) They also regularly asked us if we wanted refills for our coffee. Because of the pandemic, breakfast wasn’t a buffet-type, instead it was unlimited ala carte. We were served each a platter of fruits upon arriving, followed with a basket of breads. And boy we loved the streudel! We both had coffee and juice too. We had salmon eggs benedict and scrambled eggs set that came with 2 pcs bacon, 2 pcs sausages, hash browns, stir-fried mushrooms and tomato. We asked for a small serving of porridge and waffle too because we were quite full and they are kind enough to serve this to us. We felt bad they had to wash lots of plates and mugs because they had to bring a new cup of coffee to us after every request instead of bringing a pot to pour us a new cup. Really impressive service.
Prior our visit, we signed up in the website for Friends of MO. This allowed us to choose two of their services that is eligible for our room rate. We were privileged to receive two welcome drinks at the MO bar. Service is excellent. We tried one of their recommended drinks (but we had to request for a non-alcohol version as we have plans later that evening). They served us snacks free of charge with the drinks.
I personally enjoyed my bubble bath soak while my friend finished her book. It was very helpful to me to rest my worries and stress away from work.
In the future, we would love to go for a swim in the pool. We didn’t get to do this last time as we had to book our slots and are only allowed to stay for 2 hours. Instead, we stayed in our room to enjoy the ocean view and rest in the soft and cozy bed.

Due to the uncertainty, we threw many questions at their way, and they were always able to clear the doubts that we had. They were also accommodating with our request throughout the process for our wedding.
The set up of the event was really great. The decorations on the tables and the aisle was beautifully laid out. The stage was well-prepared for our solemnisation ceremony.
The flow of the event was smooth and as expected. Murphy, our lunch coordinator, was clear with how we wanted the program to be and ensure detailed organization at every segment of the event.
Food-wise, the guest loved it! Everyone had praise for the food, especially the Golden Fragrant Prawn and Chilli Crab
with Mantou dish. As for us, we had majority of the food in our room. It was kept warmth for consumption and we were extremely pleased.
The stay was really comfortable. The view from the room was excellent, we kept the curtains opened throughout. Everything that we needed from the room was in place.

2/3-star service:
1) we arrived at 3pm and were told the room was not ready and someone would call me when the room is ready. So we waited (fortunately they let us use the pool so my 5-year-old can be entertained). 5pm still no call and my kid got really tired so I went to ask and was told the room under my name is still dirty however they would give us another room. Why werent we given another room earlier? Clearly they forgot the waiting guests.
2) the staycation was to celebrate our anniversary and I called reservation desk a few days earlier and was told they’d arrange a cake. But of course they have forgotten.
3) during stay, we called Housekeeping for water or extra towels 3 times and 2 times the items were not delivered. In the end, we gave up and went to swimmihn pool to grab extra towels.
3-star food
1) the staycation came with a 3-course dinner. After selecting the courses, we ordered 2 glasses of wine. The wine didn’t come after the first course. My husband gave the benefit of doubt that they might want to serve it during the main course but when the main courses came, we found out that the wine order somehow wasn’t passed. So we had to order again. The kid’s main course came 15 min later than our main courses so by the time it came, we finished ours already.
2) breakfast is ala carte but the waffles were soggy when served, other food tasted mediocre. Fruit is lower quality, coffee is bad. We didn’t finish the food not th me coffee and later went to Marina Square next door to get our coffee fix.
Understand that it is COVID time and they may be short of manpower. We expected delay in service but did not expect constantly being forgotten. perhaps MO should sell less rooms if they can’t cope, so the service & food standards won’t drop so much? Very disappointed in MO and won’t return.",Date of stay: October 2020,,3,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

At the time of our visit, Covid-19 was already having a significant impact on the city, which was extremely quiet. The hotel also felt very quiet, overall. There were plenty of guests at breakfast and the pool seemed busy, albeit with restrictions, but we rarely saw people when walking around the hotel. With the roads also quiet, it took us about 20 minutes by car from Changi Airport to the hotel.
We had a thoroughly enjoyable stay in a room overlooking Marina Bay with floor to ceiling windows and spectacular views. A high floor room is always recommended. The rooms are a good size, and maintained in an excellent condition. Mandarin Oriental’s own luxury amenities are provided in the bathroom, which had both a bath tub and a separate shower cubicle.
Service was impeccable throughout our stay. Check in was quick and efficient as was check out. Breakfast at the Melt Café, one of the things I loved most about the hotel on our first visit, remains impressive with choices across many Asian and Western cuisines. We also enjoyed afternoon tea at the MO Bar which was another enjoyable experience.
Location wise, the hotel is within walking distance to everything Marina Bay has to offer from the Gardens to the Shoppes.
Overall, I cannot fault the hotel. Singapore has a vast array of top notch luxury hotels throughout the city so you are spoilt for choice. Mandarin Oriental is certainly an exceptional choice but it does come with a price tag.",Date of stay: February 2020,,5,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

Check-in was delayed by an hour, so we had to chase them and they gave us a different room. They gave us 3 drinks vouchers as a token for the late checkin which was great, but with a 1 year old who was cranky and past his sleep time, it was still abit difficult to manage. Hence we had to ask if they had any other room available.
Room was fantastic. So was the bathroom and the bathtub was so clean. I got an ocean room, the view was great. The pool is beautiful and quite resort-ish. Staff were generally excellent (the best part of the hotel really - everyone was so polite). The dinner was so-so but the breakfast was a 10/10! Loved the breakfast, I would return to Melt Cafe just for the buffet breakfast if they are open for guests. It was ala carte, and they had 8 items, but everything was splendid.
Faced a few problems with the aircon which seemed to work properly only intermittently. Was cold a moment, then not the other. Also asked for a glass, and was given a broken glass lol. And with a kid, we were quite particular about the high chairs, but twice it was dirty but they cleaned it when we requested. We would have thought it would have been cleaned thoroughly before being given to us in the first place. But all these smaller issues shouldn't mask the fact that it is a brilliant hotel. Cant fault really. I'd give a 4.5 if I could. The 0.5 was because I've experienced Ritz Carlton, and they really being service to new heights, and they are quite a formidable barometer",Date of stay: October 2020,,4,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

Furthermore, MO gave a free upgrade to Marina Bay Suite which has amazing view. Breakfast was good too, where we can order more than 1 main dish. Roti prata is a must-try dish.
However, there were certain standards that can be improved.
1) soap bar in the toilet was past expiry date
2) requested for toddler cot for a 22mo toddler weeks before check in but none arranged in the room during check in. Took 3 calls and 3h later for the cot to arrive but only to find that the cot was set at the high level for infants which is a safety issue. Housekeeping staff came back 30mins later with the correct cot. Found out from another family 2 doors away that they were given a toddler cot for their infant. Poor understanding of customer family needs.
3) Swimming pool water was very cold in the late morning

"Mandarin Oriental, Singapore",mav68,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/mav68,"Singapore, Singapore",mav68 wrote a review Oct 2020,477 contributions,Their Service Tops it All,"Stayed at Mandarin Oriental over the weekend. It has been quite a long time I have not stepped foot on this hotel. The hotel is still miraculously able to hide all the signs of aging at the age of 30+, as it opened the door in 1987. The hotel's last renovation probably was done a decade ago and I can vividly remember the hotel was closed entirely for a good 3 months. It was a transformation.
The hotel was designed by the renowned architect John Portman, known for his Atrium lobby. After so many years, I still irresistibly look up the spiral view of the atrium in awe.
The room of this luxury brand is not the largest compared to other 5 star hotels within the vicinity nor the in-room design is the swankiest amongst their rivals, not to name them to protect their interests. Even so, the room is considered well maintained, practical and comfortably meets our needs.
I got a very good deal but typically in normal circumstances the hotel pegged their rate above upper-upscale and very close to the top notch luxury sector. With that rates, I would expect at least a Nespresso Coffee Machine and some luxury bathroom amenities often found in other luxury brands, not the case for our stay but this will not reduce our enjoyment anyway, just that we have been so used to it even at home, nothing's less than that sort of pampering and indulgence.
The view from the room is remarkable, overlooking Marina Bay, mesmerising during day and captivating during night.
The room comes with a 4 features bathroom. The wall and floor are both cladded by marble though the discolouration of the marble is pretty noticeable. Nonetheless, it is still clean and acceptable overall.
There are lots of channels available for your enjoyment. Other room amenities are pretty standard such as Iron/ironing board, coffee making facilities, bathrobes, bathroom slippers, electronic safe etc.
The breakfast is served at Melt. No more self-service buffet but order from a la carte. The quality is good though. Truly 5 star standard. Spacious, many different sections, lots of seating capacity. Staff were prompt to serve and worked hard like the bee.
The hotel is strategically located at Marina district. It is just a mere 15 mins drive to the airport, sits atop a mega shopping mall - Marina Square. It is also connected to 2 MRT lines through underground mall and within walking distance to Suntec Mall, Millenia Walk, Raffles City, and other touristy places such as Esplanade, Merlion, Raffles Hotel, Civilian War Memorial, Singapore Flyer, Gardens by the Bay, MBS Casino or just take a stroll at this beautiful picturesque Marina Bay.
The pool perhaps is the highlight. Beautiful and with a nice view overlooking Marina Bay. There are many decks and poolside cabanas, but it was packed over the weekend and we could not even get a deck, but be told to go to the back far from the pool. It was a little disappointing but we understand the situation. It is not their fault.
As a Fan of MO, I was given 2 drink coupons at the MO Bar. It is an additional perks to spice up our experience at the hotel.
The highlight of the stay perhaps was because of the Front Desk staff. Polite, warmth, anticipatory, professional and efficient. Mike served us when we arrived. Within minutes we were ushered to our rooms. We promised him we will return, and we have already made the reservation for our next stay on 21-22 Nov.
Overall, it was a very satisfactory stay and MO never fails in that regards. We hope our next stay will be even more memorable. Can't wait to be back again!",Date of stay: October 2020,,5,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

The check-in process was very swift as the staff shared details our reservation and helped to ensure we make the best out of our stay.
We were then led to our room with spectacular views of the ocean, gardens by the bay and the Marina Bay Sands! No wonder they call this the Ocean Grand room. We also appreciated the gesture to decorate the room for the occasion to celebrate our anniversary~
Lunch at Bar 5 was enjoyable with the very attentive Vanessa attending to us~ mushroom soup was especially delicious!
Next, the pool with an awesome view~ though there is now a 2hr time limit, it actually enhances the experience as you can be sure the pool will not be too crowded :)
Dolce Vita was superb as usual. The cheese is a must try! Service here is consistently good and the team definately know their menu to give you the best recommendation they can offer.
We felt really pampered at the spa by Esther and Winnie~ the customized 3hr program really catered to our needs and we left the place truly rejuvenated!

The experiences at Mandarin Oriental has left us both with deep impressions that will be difficult to forget! First, upon booking confirmation, we were given instructions to reserve slots at facilities like the spa, pool and gym in advance as slots are limited due to safety measures. This was well thought out. Making the bookings for slots was also a breeze. Second, at checking in, Yvonne at reception was very warm and polite and even wished us a ""Happy Wedding Anniversary""! When we were brought to our Marina Bay View room, we were pleasantly surprised to see an elaborately decorated room with flowers, balloons, cake, fruit, and a hand written card (that had a good deal of personal effort put in) from the guest relations team. Third, the pool was wonderful with amazing views of the bay area and also lots of well shaded resting areas for chilling out. Fourth, we spent an hour in the fitness centre working out together and it was very good. It is well equipped, water and towels are provided in a clean bag, and there is very good distancing between the treadmills that have been switched on.

Had pre-dinner drinks at the MO bar and was impressed by the fact that every cocktail had its own unique backstory on the menu. Dinner at Cherry Garden was just as impressive with the great food and attentive service. Ala carte buffet breakfast was served at melt cafe with both continental and local options to choose from.
Overall an exceptional experience with great and warm hospitality despite the additional safety measures in place. An ideal property for staycations and travelers alike.",Date of stay: October 2020,,5,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

The pool even has tanning lotion, sunblock, or goggles for complimentary guest use! Fantastic speed for room service, and can almost ask for anything and will be fulfilled by the hotel staff.
The room was nicely presented to us, and the tub was prefilled with rose petals upon arrival. In-room dining was also nice. We were lucky to get the marina bay suite, as the night view of the marina bay was just so beautiful.

Every staff was exceptional - check in, luggage delivery, cleaning, restaurant, spa.... I had encounters with at least 10-15 staff and every single one was able to easily anticipate my needs without being over the top.
The City View suite was very spacious for our 2 kids and 2 adults. The beds are soft (which I love), the blackout curtains perfect, the aircon very quiet and easy to use. The only comment is that the design is a bit dated, but some could appreciate the classic design.
The swimming pool, although not particularly large, has a luxurious layout with cabanas, lounge, and beautiful views of the bay. I was able to secure spots at the pool easily and spent much of the day there.
Breakfast food is fantastic, love how they have transitioned from buffet. Fruit plates, bread basket, free-flow menu and friendly and accomodating staff is just as nice.",Date of stay: October 2020,,5,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

The view of Marina Bay was amazing, and location of the hotel being beside a shopping mall like Marina Mall was a big plus.
It will be good if the room had a small stool for children when washing their hands, as well as installation of bidets in the toilets.
We found one small issue with the lighting for sleeping and living area though. (maybe we did not control it properly) When we turn off the sleeping area lighting, we cannot turn on the lights for the main area. So can't turn on the lights as the kids need to sleep.

It always feels great to be back at Mandarin Oriental.
Staycation here is a regular or almost annual affair since my kids were young. However, the last we stayed here was probably 3 to 4 years ago as the kids became teens, they aren't as keen in staycations anymore.
After not visiting for few years, the feeling of sweet nostalgia swarmed us when we enter the hotel. Everything is still the same and seems so familiar. The cheerful and friendly staffs at the reception were always eager to serve. Aisyah, a pretty and cheerful lady checked us in and brought us up to our room.
The Marina Bay room view is superb.
Upon entering the room, we were surprised with a room filled with balloons and rose petals, not forgetting the delicious birthday cake.
We are very appreciative of this lovely gesture from the kind staffs who took the extra effort to make this a WOW experience for my Hubby birthday and anniversary.
Aisyah offered to take a photo for both of us before she leaves our room. She asked if she could also take one with her phone to share the room's decor with her team. And we agreed.
Unknowingly, about 2 hours later, a door knock came as another surprise!
Aisyah had printed the lovely photo that she took of us and along with a well-hand written card from the team! This is unexpected and yet another WOW experience.
Breakfast at Dolce Vita was delightful. Staffs were attentive and always smiling and prompt service. With the request for late check-out, we enjoyed a quiet afternoon enjoying the million dollar view and catching up on some movies.
When it's time to check-out, Shannon was quick to attend to us, everything was fuss free. We wished we could stay one more night to enjoy this impeccable service as always from Team MO.

It was our last time on a “trip” before our little one arrives, and the entire stay was a surprise by my husband. Izni who assisted us upon arrival was really friendly and had escorted us up all the way to our room (that was allocated near the lift, which I am so grateful for cause I’m 9 months pregnant and walk at a very slow speed). Inside our room was balloons decorated across our bed beautifully hand drawn by I think the Guest Relations Team “Happy Babymoon” which was so sweet. She also offered to take a picture of us that later was printed on a card with words of appreciation from the Guest relations Team.
I was also surprised with a prenatal massage booked by my husband who was liaising with The Spa receptionist Laili. She was also very friendly and cheerful when greeting us knowing it’s a surprise for me. Best massage by Esther.
That evening we went to Dolce Vita for dinner. Ronny and Giruba was very professional in their service and took very good care of us during dinner. Might I say as well, the pan fried sea bass was the highlight of the night.
On both days during breakfast, Marie graciously showed us to our table and also recognised us saying “Welcome back”.
Second night’s dinner was at Morton’s, Yana and the team made our evening entirely enjoyable and relaxed. Sorry for not remembering the two gentlemen who helped us pull out the whole table allowing us to sit comfortably in the restaurant.
On our last day, Ganesan at Bay@5 served us and even stayed on each time to chat a little was a really nice personal touch to the end of our stay.
Thank you Princes and Gabriel for your departure assistance. And to the doorman for always remembering us too!
May I add because I was heavily pregnant, during my stay whenever I go to any restaurant in MO, a staff will always offer me an additional pillow for me to lean on and this has truly made me feel extremely well taken care of by all the staff as my back was killing me during this pregnancy. Actually I would say, offering anyone (not just pregnant women) any additional assistance of some sort to make their experience more memorable because everyone was focused on me and seldom on my husband.

AMOY's hospitality started long before we even got to Singapore - from the friendly messages inquiring into our time of arrival to arranging the airport transfer.
The complimentary airport transfer was truly appreciated, especially after a long journey into Singapore. We got to the hotel much earlier than the published check-in time. We were pleasantly surprised to see our room was ready and we were checked in in no time.
The room was well appointed with comfortable furniture, air conditioning and high quality amenities - including a complimentary mini-bar which was replenished each day. After a long day out, it was a pleasure to return to such a comfortable room.
Breakfast at Dean and Deluca was good and wholesome. I must place on record our sincere gratitude to the team at Dean and Deluca for going the extra mile when it came to providing a wider variety of breakfast options to us.
There are also a large number of restaurants and eateries in the vicinity to suit different tastes and preferences. The Telok Ayer MRT station is just across the road and provides very convenient connections to just about anywhere in Singapore. There is also a taxi rank outside the hotel with ample taxis most of the time.
The best part of this hotel is the staff. Everyone from the senior most manager to the front office, the housekeeping and maintenance team members sported a smile, and carried out their work with what seemed like a sense of duty and pride. Each one of these wonderful people made us feel very welcome, and as if we were a part of their extended family. I remember with gratitude how they helped me with a fresh bucket of ice each day to help relieve my aching and swollen knees. (I would like to add - my knees are much better now thanks to your kind gesture when we stayed at AMOY. I am also grateful for the thoughtful parting gift given to when we were checking out).
Please permit me to mention the names of each of your team members (in no particular order) we met during our stay as a means of thanking each of them for their efforts in making our stay memorable: Alvin, Ramzana, Kimberley, Firdaus, Ken, Isabel, Derek, Hoong, Xiu Jing and Shi Hao.
AMOY is a unique hotel, and I would recommend it for anyone who is sick and tired of the large run of the mill hotels that merely ""copy paste"" room designs and amenities. AMOY is a hotel with a character, has a human touch to the hospitality trade and is a breath of fresh air in the overcrowded hotel sector.
My parting words to the staff was to stick to their operating philosophy, because that is what differentiated AMOY from any of the other hotels I have stayed.
Thank you very much for a lovely stay. We will be back! :)",Date of stay: March 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Raffles,,

It is located in the CBD of Singapore, with convenient transportation. The subway station is right outside the hotel.
The hotel is hidden in a century-old ancestral hall. The decoration style has a strong Chinese style. Zhao Qian Sun Li Chen Zhang...The aisle decorated with the surnames of a hundred families makes you feel more cordial in a foreign land.
The hotel is not far from Chinatown. As a Chinese, my favorite place to go is of course Chinatown, where you can eat all kinds of things that Chinese people like to eat.
The beautiful Singapore River is within easy reach. At night, stroll along the Singapore River, along the way, the Parliament, Merlion Park, Marina Bay, Sands Hotel, ""DNA"" Bridge... the most beautiful place in Singapore.
The hotel manager, Mr. Zhang Jiarong (ALVIN TEO), is very handsome and very friendly. The hotel team under his leadership is very good. After the start of COVID-19, Mr. ALVIN TEO showed amazing leadership, maintained the hotel's consistent service standards, and provided me with thoughtful service.

Rooms are smallish but nicely designed; there is a nespresso machine, tea, snacks, and a few cold drinks in the mini fridge all complimentary. Location was perfect — just a few blocks to Chinatown, Club Street, Ann Siang Road and several hawker centers. You can also walk to Marina Bay Sands and Gardens by the Bay (a longer walk - maybe a mile or so). Note: I stayed at Amoy on a weekend and the streets were fairly deserted due to the hotel’s location in the business center of Singapore.

Stayed for only 1 night but was utterly impressed by this hotel. Even surpassed my satisfaction from staying at 5-star hotels in Singapore (St. Regis, Fullerton, Westin, Mandarin Oriental).
Check in
2 days prior to my arrival, I received an email from the hotel offering a complimentary pick up from the hotel. The hotel agreed to drop me off at a different location (5-minute away from the hotel). Once I landed, I was picked up on a Mercedes and the experience was smooth and easy. As a business traveler, I very much appreciated this.
Room and amenities
I am personally not a fan of the hotel's design (I normally prefer a discreet, quiet hotel), and I found the hallways of the hotel to be stuffy. The room (a single-bed room) was small. However, I had everything I needed in the room. I also loved the bathroom design - has a waterfall shower head with wood flooring. Also, I was surpised to learn that the minibar is complimentary (6 types of different drinks including a Heineken).
Service
Based on my experience, staff at 4-star hotels are just alright. However, the staff here are amazing. Very friendly and they are the reason why this hotel is so impressive. Quite incredible!

Finally this year we did a three week swing through Southeast Asia (Vietnam Cambodia Thailand Malaysia Singapore). I had very high expectations, (all met or exceeded for that matter) for the first four countries on this trip and very low expectations for our last country, Singapore. I expected just another metropolis which tempered any excitement- Seen one, seen them all, and for that matter the hotels that reside therein. Then we arrived in Singapore…
Our first stop of course was checking in at the hotel. Now originally I had reservations at another property made several months earlier. And like a lot of places, they keep your credit card on file and charge you anywhere from a day to a couple weeks before your arrival. Well just so happened that the credit card on file was no longer valid. And I got an email from that Hotel telling me the room is no longer available! So three days before our departure I scramble to find alternate accommodations and stumbled across the Amoy hotel. My criteria was simple – must be a boutique hotel and in or very near Chinatown. Amoy seemed to fit the bill and through its website seemed quite charming. We fell in love with this property upon arrival. Loved how Front desk was almost an afterthought and just kind of blended into the background where we felt like we were walking into a temple (and in fact we really were!) The openness to the space where are you walk from essentially a pedestrian zone on one side into an enclosed boutique market style cafés and restaurants in an alley on the other side. Really hard to explain, but you need to experience it to understand the wonderfulness of it all!
Kimberly greeted us on our arrival and she was very sweet very professional very on point and made us feel very welcome and comfortable. She even escorted us personally to our room to show us all the features. And what fabulous accommodations – the wide plank oak floors the beautiful tiles the walk in shower, all very upscale. Wonderful water pressure! Plenty of complementary beverages and snacks. We didn’t stay but an hour in the room before we ventured out to explore Chinatown and enjoy a night out. But unfortunately it seems my husband caught a bit of food poisoning through one of the street vendors. So upon our return shortly there after things didn’t go well for him and it was a rough night. The next morning he still wasn’t feeling too well insisted I go out and enjoy myself so I did. And in my absence he took a turn for the worse and RAMZANAH Who is working front desk this afternoon walked him to a local clinic and upon his return from the clinic offered to extend his (our) day at this beautiful hotel several hours while he recuperated! Such customer service is unheard of. And to RAMZANAH, KIMBERLY and the rest of the staff of this outstanding property we thank you all from the bottom of our hearts. We will definitely be back in Singapore in the not-too-distant future and we will definitely be staying in your wonderful property again!",Date of stay: January 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Raffles,,

At check in, I was shown the room facilities which included a nespresso coffee machine, and free use of mini bar. I was intrigued by the museum and asked if there were tours. The front reception staff Derek said there were none but offered to tell me more himself. I asked for the newspaper the next day and Kimberly at front reception ensured I had daily papers for the duration of my 3 night stay. I was also offered a room to freshen up in the afternoon after my check out (but I came back too late and didn't need this in any case) and drinks whilst I was waiting for my friend. The service was exemplary and I have only described some examples. A special shout out to Derek who was the main staff member I interacted with, but all staff were consistently great. The convenience of being right opposite an MRT station and the museum/temple setting made the stay even better. Although there was supposedly some noise from the renovations of the hotel, this didn't bother me and I didn't need the earplugs that were supplied but appreciated the thought.

The location is great. MRT (metro) station Telok Ayer is across the street. A complimentary hotel minivan picked us up from the airport when we arrived. The room came with a few snacks and about 5 or 6 canned beverages in the fridge which were all included. Breakfast was provided next door at the Dean & Deluca and was very tasty.
The Receptionist and staff who helped us with our bags to our room were all super friendly and helpful. The perimeter of Chinatown was about a block away. What we barely found out towards the end of our one night stay was the Hong Lim Market was in the opposite direction of where we headed initially to go into Chinatown. I guess the best way I can describe it is you have to head northwest from the hotel? There are tons of great restaurants around the hotel and in Chinatown but we had our favorite food experiences at the Hong Lim hawker stalls. While it was about 3-4 blocks away, it was actually all covered by massive canopies so even though it was pouring rain for an hour, we were still able to make it back and forth without an umbrella.
Anyhow, nothing but praise for the AMOY hotel and its staff. Thank you.",Date of stay: October 2019,,5,,,,,,,,Raffles,,

Breakfast provision was a voucher presented at the nearby Dean & Deluca - breakfast was a little average, but good enough. The hotel was a little noisy late one night, but the Grand Prix was on and we think there was an event being held very close by. The Amoy is a very short walk to the MRT and bus stops.

It's built on the site of a former temple, and is rich with history. The service and staff were very friendly, helpful and accommodating!
We were picked up by a car service, provided by the hotel, at the airport which was so helpful and kept us from stressing about how to get to the hotel. Our check-in was smooth and quick and we had assistance getting our bags up to our room. The rooms are small- but we had plenty of room for our 3 bags! There's space to hang your items and place your garments, so it was great. It was very modern and comfortable. They had a Nespresso coffee machine, a mini bar and snacks - AND some souvenir gifts that was so thoughtful. Wifi was strong and free, which was appreciated.
The location was just blocks away from Chinatown and a short walk from Clarke Quay. We enjoyed walking around and seeing the sights every day. The hotel staff was very helpful in explaining the MRT and how to get around and providing maps- so we were able to take that to Little India and to the River Safari.
They provided suggestions of places to eat - and we also were appreciative of the breakfast provided by Dean & Deluca around the corner. Good menu options every day and not crowded.
When we checked out, they rang for a taxi for us and even offered to arrange a take away breakfast for us, as our flight left very early.

You get a fan and a paper umbrella as souvenirs, nice touch!
The building is charming, in fact it is a major attraction for groups of visitors. Location is perfect for Chinatown and the business district.
Wifi is fast and reliable. However, the handy phone that is still advertised on Booking.com is no longer offered!! That was a bit of a disappointment.
Breakfast is so-so in the nearby Dean&Deluca restaurant. I was here before and have very fond memories of when it was served in-house with a generous spread and personalized service.
Ask for a quiet room in the back, away from the noisy pub downstairs.

From their front desk personnel, security to their housekeepers, all I have are kudos to this excellent team!
I am a frequent traveler and would have expected this from the bigger, luxury hotel chains but am excited and very impressed that a boutique hotel like the Amoy outperforms the likes of The Ritz, The Four Seasons, the Marriotts or The Westins. Nothing beats personal service. It’s one of the many reasons for brand loyalty and in our world now where social media rules, word-of-mouth will definitely earn new customers for you.
The hotel's location sold the property to me only to realize that they can outperform the biggest brands out there. From the in-room nespresso machines, to the free mini-bar, the wonderful breakfast at Dean & Deluca, the very ""handy"" phone that includes unlimited data and calling to some countries and comes with tips/discounts to make for a memorable trip to the limo to or from the airport, and the walking guides -- everything will wow you!

We stayed at The Quincy for four nights and then here for one. Same brand, but The Quincy is a much better run and managed property.
The Good
The location was absolutely excellent with a really authentic old school feel. You're near dozens of sites, restaurants, and MRT stations. A very central feel and easily walkable to the MBS laser show.
The hotel itself is housed in a great building and makes a fun experience for one night. The grounds are very traditional and well taken care of.
The deluxe king was great, but it is small for two people for more than a night or two. There is very little privacy between the restroom and the bedroom, just slightly frosted glass. If you're with a spouse or partner it's fine, but I wouldn't be comfortable even with my family.
Service and staff where very friendly and seemed like nice people. It just didn't seemed like they were managed well, The Quincy everyone seemed well prepared and we'll managed.
The Bad
Small issues, but at the price point they shouldn't happen.
Upon arrival no greeting, just kinda trudged my luggage in and was then recognized as a guest. I believe the lobby is a corporate center cut through, so it might be tough to tell who is a guest and who isn't.
No shampoo in the shower, or anywhere in the room. Not a huge deal, but not 4 star service or attention to detail.
Departure car was 10 minutes late
while standing in super humid and hot weather. Staff decided to flag a taxi, then car shows up and it's just awkward.
Internet was down for at least a few hours, again not a huge deal, but the issues just added up.
Overall it's fun for a night, but if the price is similar at other hotels nearby, use them. The Quincy was much cheaper, same brand, and was far superior.",Date of stay: July 2019,,3,,,,,,,,Raffles,,

On the other hand - a light sleeper businessman whose done 13 hours on a plane and a busy week ahead - avoid this place like it has The bubonic plague or Ebola.
Every single lovely feature of this authentic ChopHouse boutique experience is trashed by its location. My room was one floor above a strip of bars and restaurant combos - loud music fun good times and noodle salad for the revellers but not if you need sleep.
Further, at the end of the indoor strip is a serious set of bars music and bottles, this hotel is over a strip of bars clubs restauants and joints that kick on to 2230. Music laughter good time and noodle salad but not so good when the speakers are under your window ( see bottle idol below ) -,-at the end of the street is main action bars bites and bottle dropping which kick on until 23:59
Then, let’s not forget the strip is an open thoroughfare - loads of night workers use the empty tables from about 0100 to 330 am to phone home and snack - none of them had a good connection given they were shouting a la Dom Jolly
“YEAH - Singapore....what ? YEA- hot .... I said hooot!”
So you might get asleep c 230 am but of course they keep the best TIL last ....BOTTLE IDOL!
At 4 am to 5 am all the empty bottles - care of wheelie bins have a race to see who can get on the garbage truck first - so loud, so vibrant, such fun and so sleep crushing
In four nights I got a total of 8.5 hours sleep - let that sink in
Some other points - just to ensure the coffin lid stays firmly closed on this vampiric sleep stealer.
1. I booked a double - they firmly insisted I booked a single - my invoice confirmed me right - 40 mins at checkin - not ideal
2. The rooms - single glazing, lighting so so so dark and if you are claustrophobic or got upset by shower scene in schindlers list this one is probably not for you
3. Free mini bar and nice touches with zen little quotes on the pillow that lost their appeal when Barry and Chee Wan are having a relationship busy up volume ten 0100
4. Shops and bars have burglar alarms - they go off and in this zone you can hear them - I suppose when outside your window understandable- but took hours to switch off - giving the Confucius he say “ sleep is the bringer of serenity and life balance” into somewhat of a theoretical concept in this hotel
5. Lots of nice touches - but none of them outweigh enforced insomnia

The room, while a little light on for space, was perfect for me as I didn't need to spend much time in the room. I really liked the extra touches at this hotel - they would deliver a treat and a little card. The service from the reception staff was also exceptional.
I would stay here again - this hotel is very centrally located close to many restaurants and the MRT is across the road meaning you can access most places in Singapore quickly.

The single and double rooms are both comfortable, if not very large, and have a modular design with tasteful nods to the building's origin as a row of shophouses. Go for a double room if you can, because the beds are distinctly more comfortable. The wifi is good, and the hotel provides a ""Handyphone"" mobile phone for guest use (outgoing calls, GPS navigation, web access, etc.). The staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. Though there is no on-site catering, you get breakfast coupons for nearby Dean and Deluca (a well-known upmarket US chain). While these don't get you access to the full menu, what they provide is perfectly fine. In the unlikely event that you are still hungry, order more from the Dean and Deluca menu, visit Ya Kun Kaya Toast (no air conditioning) in the attached Far East Square, or go to one of the (more expensive) coffee shops across Telok Ayer Street opposite the hotel. You are also next door to a huge variety of restaurants, and within easy walking distance of three of Singapore's legendary hawker centres. If you arrive in Singapore early, beware of using the hotel's free airport pickup service, as you are unlikely to get early checkin and will have to leave your bags and walk around in the famously humid climate. Better to hang out at the airport and take the MRT or a taxi, and ask to use the hotel's free car service as a dropoff to the airport instead.

I believe that encompasses the hotel and it’s ethos and on my next trip there is no doubt where I will be staying. The attention to details is what makes the difference for me. An example - I returned later afternoon and was handed a bottle of chilled water as I walked through the lobby. The staff were friendly and eager to assist. My stay started before I even got to the hotel with privateAirport pick up. My last visit to Singapore with a much bigger hotel chain offered no complimentary airport pick up or drop off.
If you are there for work, the business district is a stones throw from the hotel and there are so many options for bars and restuarants within walking distance.
The rooms are exactly as pictured and well presented. You also are given a device during your stay to use to help get you around Singapore with all the touristy places for booking at your fingertips.
Ideal for single or couple travelling and visiting Singapore, especially for business.
MRT station across the road and if you love hawkers food halls, there is one less that 5mins walk from the hotel.

The hotel was much quieter than expected but we put that down to the virus.
On arrival our check in was quick and efficient. Our bags were delivered to our room shortly after arrival.
We were on the 28th floor and had a beautiful room that overlooked Marina Bay, a truly beautiful view which was as lovely by day as it was by night.
The room had a huge bed with the softest pillows and perfect mattress which enabled us to have to best nights sleep. The room had tea and coffee making facilities but they could have done with providing
a few more supplies in my opinion. We did ring house keeping who replenish our supplies quickly.
The room overall was beautifully furnished and had a beautiful bathroom with separate rain shower.
The Pan Pacific is ideally located for exploring Singapore and is only a few minutes walk from the nearest MRT and located next to two shopping centres one of
which you can access directly from the hotel.
The staff on reception are extremely courteous and are very happy to help to ensure your stay is the 5 star experience you would expect.
The pool is located on the 4th floor and is the little oasis amongst the towering buildings surrounding it, we loved to spend a few hours after a busy day of sightseeing there.
Thank you Pan Pacific, we loved our 4 night stay and would not hesitate in returning.
If anyone is concerned about visiting due to the virus, please be reassured that Singapore is taking the situation very seriously, everywhere is spotless clean and temperature checks are carried out just
about everywhere you go. I would not have travelled there if I had any reservations.",Date of stay: March 2020,,5,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

Our high tea was ended on a sweet note with special treat of their cake in celebration of my friend's upcoming wedding.

The room was lovely and modern with fantastic views of the Marina Bay Sands hotel, the harbour and over Singapore. The bed was huge and very comfy. The desk and drinks station with fridge were a bonus. The bathroom was large and with a full size bath and separate walk in shower.
Breakfast was vast, there was just sooo much choice and of excellent quality too. Also had snacks at the bar, which is situated in the lobby.
The pool area was neat and clean and there is also a spa but we did not use this.
The room was cleaned thoroughly every day and the rest of the hotel was also immaculate.
It is also ideally situated for all the local attractions, many of which can be accessed on foot. Taxis are also very reasonable.

Check in was quick and the staff, Miho, I think, was quick to notice the anniversary indicated in the reservation and sent a sweet treat promptly. Got the room 3117. Definitely recommend opting for a high floor and a harbour view. The bed is so comfy that you can melt into it.
Had a go at their buffet breakfast. Big spread but it was a tad disappointing to find out that they had run out of cornflakes. The staff could have also been a little more observant in noticing that I was done with the tea and could have asked if I wanted a refill. Such little things go a long way. Same goes for the housekeeping where they failed to notice that the shower gel was finished and did not replace it.
But all minor grievances aside, it was a darn good stay. It's also located next to City Hall, hence centrally-located with plenty of food options outside.",Date of stay: March 2020,,4,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

My wife and I booked a Pacific Harbour Room with access to the Pacific Club Lounge on the 38th floor, which I highly recommend. The staff at the hotel were very friendly and helpful, and they treated us like we were royalty. The food and drinks served at the Pacific Club lounge at breakfast and again at afternoon tea and cocktail hour, was delicious and they served a good variety of gourmet food. The room itself was large, very clean, very comfortable, and had a great view out to the harbor and Marina Bay Sands hotel and the Gardens of the Bay supertrees. The location of the hotel was great – it was a five minute walk for us to the Promenade MRT station, and from there we were able to access all of the places we wanted to go in Singapore. It was also a short walk through the adjacent SunTec City shopping mall from where we took the Hop On Hop Off bus one day. The hotel is linked by sky bridge or underground to at least three shopping malls, and you can walk underground through air-conditioned malls all the way to City Hall and perhaps beyond that. Overall, a fantastic experience and I am recommending to all of my friends that they should visit Singapore some day and stay at the Pan Pacific with access to the Club Lounge.",Date of stay: March 2020,,5,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

The reservation lady wasn't very friendly. She was cold and did not seem interested to help me at all. I almost wanted to check out the neighbouring hotels, e.g. Mandarin Oriental, Westin, Ritz Carlton, Conrad, etc. However, I am really keen to celebrate my wife's birthday in their City Suites room, and that was why I can tolerate her poor attitude. She responded that there are 8 such suites in the hotel and it is better to check the availability at the counter upon check-in.
On 7 Mar, I stopped by the hotel to confirm the availability of City Suites room. I was impressed by the professionalism of Rhea and especially the Duty Manager, Roxanne. Roxanne has been very patient and helpful to confirm the availability, yet friendly to engage customers like my family. She requested for higher floor for us and picked a non-smoking room further away from lift lobby. She was prompt to arrange a roll-away bed for my boys and eclaires for my wife's birthday surprise.
Within such a short timeframe while arranging for our check-in, my family is totally at ease and comfortable with her!
Yes, Pan Pacific is a renowned 5-star hotel. But the poor service of that reservation lady almost turn me away.
It is people like Roxanne who is passionate about their work, passionate about offering great service who can uphold the reputation and customer loyalty of the hotel.

Conveniently situated close to the Marina Bay area, the 790-room hotel offers easy access to Promenade and Esplanade MRT station as well as nearby shopping malls such as Marina Square and the sprawling Suntec City, with an air-conditioned underground connection all the way to City Hall MRT interchange station and the Raffles City shopping complex. Changi Airport is about 20 minutes away by car, while Marina Bay Sands is a few MRT stations away.
PAN PACIFIC SINGAPORE
Opened in 1986, the property’s architectural design bears all the hallmarks of the distinctive style of its neo-futuristic architect John Portman, known for the dramatic skylights, glass elevators and soaring atria featured across his projects. Past the property’s front doors, guests are greeted by the stunning visual of lantern-like canopies suspended over lobby lounge Atrium’s intimate seating pods scattered across the space. The pods seemingly float above the surface of a reflection pool, which catches light from the skylight at the end of the towering atrium which extends 35 floors upwards. Timber bridges and walkways providing access to the pods further enhances the island imagery.
Bubble lifts transport guests to their various destinations, with different lift lobbies catering to different halves of the hotel. The bubble lift ride up to the Pacific Club - situated on the hotel’s apex level - is quite the experience, given how the lift is located on the outside of the building and gives guests a lovely scenic view as it breezes past the highest levels of nearby buildings.
The hotel boasts eight dining and entertainment concepts: all-day dining buffet restaurant Edge; Chinese restaurant Hai Tien Lo; lobby lounge Atrium; tropical poolside space Poolside Bar; Japanese restaurant Keyaki; award-winning Indian fine dining concept Rang Mahal; night-time entertainment venue LuLu's Lounge; as well as casual cafe Pacific Marketplace.
Being a business hotel, the property houses a Pacific Centre on the 22nd level which provides event and meeting spaces along with modern business facilities such as laptop loans and secretarial services such as translation services. Elsewhere, the Pacific Hospitality Lounge on the 4th level provides a comfortable space - think sofa seating and massage chairs - for those who require a resting area due to early arrival or a late flight out.
In terms of wellness, the hotel’s St. Gregory Spa is situated on the 4th level alongside the semi-circular swimming pool (and the wading pool for families), steam rooms, tennis courts and 24-hr fitness centre. The 4th level also houses a children's playground as well as an expansive garden area, including an herb garden which provides ingredients for the hotel's kitchens.
DELUXE BALCONY ROOM
Boasting an outdoor balcony directly facing the Marina Bay area with outdoor chairs for the comfort of cigarette-fuelled contemplative moments or sunset appreciation sessions, the 46sqm Deluxe Balcony Room plays it all conventional business hotel in its stylings. The workspace is fitted with a conventional glass table-top and an ergonomic Herman Miller desk chair, while the fridge from the minibar is one of those annoying antiquated computerised ones which are fully stocked with canned drinks, snacks and bottles of spirits which are not capable of being removed to make space for your own wares lest you wish to have the items charged to your account.
The glass partition separates the bedroom area from the enclosed rainfall shower in the bathroom. The shower area is suitably spacious, with automated blind controls in case you i) share the room with your Grandma; or ii) wish to admire the bay area while wet and au naturel. (Given the hotel’s proximity to the external balconies of the Mandarin Oriental, Singapore which face your room, the latter may be an option you want to weigh before proceeding.) Bathroom amenities bear the brand ""Embrace"".
For my stay, I had booked an entry Deluxe Room, and received a one-category upgrade by virtue of my GHA Discovery Platinum status. The room does not come with access to the Pacific Club, which I made separate arrangements for.
PACIFIC CLUB
Perched at the top of the hotel on the 38th level and boasting one of the most magnificent 360° club lounge views in Singapore, the Pacific Club serves various food presentations such as champagne breakfast (!), afternoon tea as well as evening cocktails. The space plays it all elegant Oriental in persuasion with embroidered lampshades, blue plush sofas and exquisite sculptures and artefacts on display.
The food presentations at the Pacific Club are fairly splendid in terms of sheer variety. Breakfast at the Pacific Club was a quiet and luxurious affair, with your choice of either Taittinger Brut Champagne or Laurent-Perrier Cuvée Rosé to go with a la minute creations such as Scrambled Eggs and French Toast. The afternoon tea was quite the substantial bonanza - while the sweets selection was suitably extensive - think Matcha Red Bean Cake, Gluten Free Brownies, Royaltine Entremet and Assorted Peranakan Rice Cakes - there were also enough savoury options such as Roast Beef Salad, Spicy Prawn Salad and Vegetable Samosa to make the seating a proper meal in its own right.
My favourite session would be their evening cocktails and canapés presentation, which similarly offers enough substance and variety to ensure you can conclude all dining activities for the day at the club lounge. The spread comprises savoury dishes such as Szechuan Smoked Salmon, Black Pepper Seafood Stew and Fried Chicken as well as sweets such as Black Forest Cake, Black Velvet Cake and Bread and Butter Pudding with Creme Anglaise. In terms of booze, the Taittinger Brut Champagne and Laurent-Perrier Cuvee Rosé continue to be free-flow (with sparkling wine such as Miguel Torres Santa Digna Estelado Rosé also available) alongside a selection of wines and spirits. The lounge also offers a menu of cocktails, from signature Pacific cocktails such as Pacific Basiltini (gin, elderflower syrup, fresh basil, lime juice, ginger, bitters) and Pacific Sunset (rum, orange, grapefruit, pomegranate bitters) to classics such as Negroni, Singapore Sling, Lychee Martini, Manhattan and Whisky Sour.
One of my Pacific Club visits during evening cocktails and canapés was via the use of a GHA Discovery Local Experience. During that particular visit, the team presented to us in a special wooden box some local snacks and two unique welcome drinks as part of the Local Experience, one of which being a particularly boozy take on the local coffee-shop drink Milo Dinosaur. It was a nice touch.
CONCLUDING THOUGHTS
While the hotel's age is visually evident and the time-locked guest rooms are not an immediate choice for either a romantic staycation or a playful gathering of friends, the hotel's commendable location as well as the Pacific Club lounge experience alone warrant the price of admission.

Have to talk about that breakfast buffet. Wow. A huge spread of food across so many different cuisines - lots of choice for even the picky eater. Dumplings, curry, rice, noodles, cakes, jelly, chocolate, the staples (egg, bacon, sausage, tomato, mushroom ...) and much more.
The other thing is they are great at providing a little extra something should there be a birthday, anniversary or other special event during your stay. It was an anniversary on mine and so in the room was a platter of petit cakes and chocolate dipped strawberries which were definitely enjoyed.
I highly recommend staying at Pan Pacific Singapore.",Date of stay: December 2019,,5,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

We celebrated a big anniversary on the trip and were treated to cakes and a beautifully decorated bed!
We had opted to have a club room, and I would highly recommend this if you are on holiday. We were on the 34th floor with a view across to the Marina May Sands and the CBD. Rooms was spacious and comfortable, with a great bathroom, though not an enormous amount of cupboard space.
With the club bedroom comes access to the panoramic club floor with afternoon tea and a two hour drinks and nibbles option. We sat looking out onto amazing views drinking delicious Laurent Perrier rose champagne (generously refilled without having to ask) feeling like we could not have chosen anywhere better to stay. The hosts in the club room were charming, as were all the staff at the hotel.
We ate breakfast at The Edge which was best on a weekday and early rather than in the rush of the weekend breakfasters. The choice was phenomenal, and what with that, and the club floor nibbles, we were able to forego lunches.
We would absolutely recommend the Pan Pacific and would definitely stay there agai. If we are lucky enough to return to Singapore.",Date of stay: February 2020,,5,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

Contemporary it is not, traditional more like. Big grand lobby with a view straight up to the ceiling (30+ floors). Property seems large and grand upon first glance.
Check-in: Quick, and improved such that the paperwork is on an iPad. Coming in during the period of COVID-19, a quick declaration was needed which did not take long at well. A $100 dollar (per night) deposit was required for my pre-paid room which is a norm for such hotels of this standard.
Room: As we were celebrating a special occasion, got a complimentary upgrade to a Deluxe Balcony room which seems to be the same as the Deluxe room, just with a balcony. The upgrade was appreciated but didn't use the balcony at all. Toilet was nice and large, shower area had 3 different types of showers and a seat to watch the outside TV on, through a massive window. The toilet and the wardrobe shared the same door, which was a different touch but I guess saved a lot of space. Minibar was very well stocked. Tea and Coffee amenities were standard (not Nespresso/capsule).
Gym/Pool: Went for a walk at night around the pool area and I have to say, it was very well laid out and had a nice feel to it. It was quiet that evening and I happened to chance upon a business lounge type area for guests to use just next to the pool. The Gym was large and had all the usual hotel gym equipment which was sufficient for a quick workout.
Breakfast: Breakfast at The Edge restaurant on level 3 was huge! Great variety of cuisines. The Japanese section could have done with some improvements though. Paneer Masala was absolutely great but unfortunately was not replenished once finished. Omelette station was great. The cheese selection wasn't fantastic, but the Burrata was great. The Edge is well known for their dinner buffets and I have had the privilege of dining for that once before. But for a breakfast, I have not come across a property with such a huge variety as of yet.
Location: 5/5 - Hotel was connected to Marina Square (shopping center), which is connected to 2 other hotels. Convenience doesn't get much better than that. Ample parking in the basement with no shortage of spaces.
Service: Didn't get the chance to have much interaction with the staff, so I can't really say much.
Overall, i'd recommend this hotel to anyone if the price is right!",Date of stay: February 2020,,4,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

Took a taxi from the airport here - took us around 20 minutes ish and was around the $25/30 which was great
We had a twin room with a balcony and found it to be spacious, clean and more than comfortable
The shower was huge and had 3 shower head options! Provided toiletries were lovely too
The hotel was ideally located for us. Around a 20/25 minute walk to the marina bay sands or a cheap enough taxi ride elsewhere, here’s where we rode to:
Zoo - $28
Universal studios - can’t remember exactly but was less than $20
Airport - $25/30
The breakfast choice was excellent. A buffet style with everything ranging from waffles, to eggs cooked anyway fresh to order, to noodles, to pastries, cereals, fruits and breads. All fresh as can be, with friendly service and set us up for the day
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would love to return one day

Not suspect that I’ve already checked in and decorated the place beforehand.
So I went to fetch my boyfriend to the hotel and was served by a very nice Indian lady (I forgot her name 😭) and she played along with my plan so nicely! We went up to the room and my boyfriend had the surprise of his life when he saw his close friends and family gathered together.
The next day when I checked out, Riko and that same nice Indian lady (I’m so sorry I forgot your name 😭😭) remembered me from the day before and asked how the surprise went. They’re literally the best!!! The room was also so spacious and amazing I really couldn’t ask for anything more!! 10/10 would recommend to my friends and family and I will definitely come back to stay again.

I was impressed with the cozy and well-decorated layout of the hotel lobby and atrium. Just from the outlook and intricate design of the atrium, one must admit that this is a 5-star hotel.
Our Dinner and Dance was held at one of the ballrooms. The space for the cocktail reception was quite limited. There were instant photo booths and game machines to entertain the officers and the limited space appeared packed and crowded.
The ballroom was quite large and the stage was central. The sound system was excellent. The food was sumptuous. The Chinese set of menu comprised the following dishes:
(a) Combination of deluxe appetizers (Vietnamese Spring Rolls, etc)
(b) Braised seafood with Shredded Sea Whelk
(c) Crab meat and Sea Cucumber
(d) Roasted Chicken with Crispy Minced Garlic
(e) Steamed Sea Bass in with Chef's Special Sauce
(f) Deep fried Prawns with Wasabi Mayo
(g) Braised Fresh Mushrooms and Shimeiji Mushrooms with Spinach
(h) Seafood Fried Rice with Silver Fish and Tobico
(i) Chilled Cream of Mango with Sago
The Shredded Sea Whelk, crab meat and sea cucumber soup was very nourishing with rich ingredients. The Steamed Sea Bass was fresh, soft and tender. The Deep fried Prawns tasted well with the wasabi. The Shimeiji Mushrooms was easy to swallow as it was well-cooked and soft. The Seafood Fried Rice tasted fragrant with many rich ingredients: egg, silver fish and tobico seem better than Yang Zhou Fried Rice.
Service was prompt in clearing our plates and topping up our drinks. I understand from the organizing committee that one table costs about $820/- but this price in a 5 star hotel with such delicious food is reasonable. The Master of Ceremony was a comedian and with his humorous jokes coupled with such delicious and sumptuous dinner, I really enjoyed the whole night at the ballroom and you hear laughter rocked the whole ballroom.

On arrival we were greeted in a very warm manor and despite arriving at 7am we were given access our room straight away.
This allowed us and our 4 month old to get some rest after a long flight from Africa. We enjoyed a delicious breakfast in-bed, delivered in record time (a nice touch was being able to request the room service cart to be removed at the touch of a button).
Due to some breakdown in communication, we only stayed for one day, not the 4 nights I had booked. I explained the reasoning to the hotel manager and they agreed to issue a full refund and didn't charge us for the time we had already spent there (I offered to pay for that night but they insisted it was not required).
A special mention to Shine Naw and the management team who dealt with us on the day. The service was efficient and more than polite.

I have stayed I. Several hotels in Singapore, but this stay stands out due to the personal service, attentiveness of staff and welcome feel about the hotel. I stayed in the pacific club room, with pacific club access and the amenities were equal to or exceeded any other ‘club’ offering in many other hotels in Singapore. I travel here 2-3 times a year and have sampled several.
To be fair to people considering this hotel, the room size is very good for a ‘club’ level room, the bathrooms are ‘original’ and I did have an issue with a broken toilet seat and the shower mixer setting control which was faulty, but maintenance was on to it within minutes and both were repaired/replaced promptly, (I was on the way to breakfast and was repaired upon my return) and a bowl of fruit and afternoon snacks were promptly placed in my room.
It was also my birthday, and quite frankly I’ll never forget the amazing staff ‘happy birthday’ song and incredible cake, as well as champagne at breakfast and to top it all off, an in-room afternoon tea spread, all courtesy of concierge and no previous idea they had organised it. I even had a card delivered to the room with a picture of myself and said cake/champagne in the club lounge.

The hotel is close to Marina Bay and the Gardens as well as Merlion Park, Raffles and shopping malls. The Gardens are fantastic by day and the light show at 7.45 is absolutely amazing as the Big trees light up in time to music. Follow that with the Marina Bay light show(8.00/9.00) and eat at the Merlion Park restaurants and you will have a perfect night out within a short distance from the hotel.
We had a panoramic view room on 30th Floor which was worth the extra. The bathroom was particularly smart but the whole room felt luxurious. We enjoyed the oustide lift for the views and also the swimming pool is comfortable equipped for a relaxing afternoon. They did good value snacks there as well cocktails, the changing rooms were smart so it was a good place to wait for a late night flight.
The Edge provided a delicous and comprehensive breakfast and generally we thought the food was good value compared with outside the hotel which could be very pricey(especially Boat Quay, avoid!)
The staff were friendly and helpful including reception, concierge, and business centre people.
We would defintely recommend this hotel for a Singapore stop over. We stayed three nights which gave us enough time to visit all the places we wanted to which included The Botanic Gardens(stunning), China Town and Little India and have a Singapore Sling in Raffles(go early to avoid queues)",Date of stay: February 2020,,5,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

On arrival at 9am following a 13 hour flight we found the room was already available for us which doesn’t happen very often.
The amenities were all first class and it very quickly showed why it is a 5star hotel.
As with a top class hotel you expect to pay a bit more for food and drink, but to be honest it wasn’t much more than bars and restaurants around the city.
Our room on the 21st floor gave fabulous views of downtown Singapore. The bed was very comfortable although I was that tired after the flight I would have slept on a wooden bench.
The room came with mini bar and the usual room service. Breakfast was extra but it was plentiful to feed the day ahead sightseeing.
As a five star it was great value for money considering the cost of a nights stay at the famous Marina Bay Sands down the road.
Well recommended. Staff very friendly and helpful as well.",Date of stay: January 2020,,5,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

My room at the Pan Pacific overlooked The Bay and gave me excellent views, including the Marina Bay Sands and all of the surrounding attractions. With excellent housekeeping services, my room was always welcoming and very easy to relax in to following a day of Singapore sightseeing. I had booked a 'Club' room and that came with breakfast, afternoon tea, evening canapés and cocktails - Superb! The crew in the Club Lounge were outstanding; professional, courteous, helpful, friendly and humorous whilst being very eager to offer assistance.
The hotel is in a good position for the Bay activities and 2 MRT stations are close by, which give you full access to the network with Changi Airport being a short taxi ride away. The majority of popular areas are within easy reach of the Pan Pacific either on foot or by MRT.
The pool area is well kept with cabanas and seating areas available. The pool is a decent size although not very deep. This is not a criticism, simply an observation. The interior of the hotel is modern, fresh and spacious with a very generous lobby area accommodating multiple seating areas and the usual hotel lobby offerings.

The Harbour Studio lived up to expectations with glorious views over the Marina Bay and gave us during the Chinese New Year celebration, the chance to be thrilled with the fireworks from our vantage situation!
Breakfast at the Edge was good with plenty of choices.
The Atrium was also good for drinks or a small lunch.
The Edge evening dinner is a self service buffet, with so much choice, the sea food bar stood out.
The best for us turned out to be the Hai Tien Lo, Cantonese restaurant. Food and service were top class with a special mention to Apple who look after two very jet lagged travellers with kindness and efficiency during our first visit. So good we went back the following evening.
As the hotel is linked to the Marina Mall, it is easy to access the whole Marina Bay Area. It is also a short walk from the Marina Bay Sands complex and the wonderful Gardens by the Bay.

The check in process took at most 5 minutes and she was very steady in communicating with us relevant information to make our stay as fuss free as possible.
The room allocated to us was at the highest floor as per request, although subject to availability. Nothing to complain about honestly. Fluffy beds, clean room, powerful AC for a warm day and great shower facilities! Bookings for the fitness center, pool and breakfast timings were also made easy by just arranging with their crews over the phone. We also have a birthday platter arranged and the cake was really nice!
As we booked through a 3rd party for a promotion with dining credits, we chose to dine at Man Fu Yuan! I’m impressed with the service as well. Louie and Joanne are both very attentive despite the restaurant being pretty busy during the dimsum buffet timings. We did wait for abit for food to arrive but Louie and Joanne both came to check and help us get our orders served as soon as they can. Like many recommended, the food did not disappoint.

It was also because of the hotel’s location, its architecture and the service rendered by the team members.
After being given a warm welcome by the concierge and reception desks’ team members, I felt sure that my stay would be great. The room I was assigned to was fantastic on all counts. It was spacious and had plush furnishings and the bed was so comfortable I found myself refusing to get out of it.
Do note that you have to book a slot for the use of the pool, and weekend breakfast slots must be strictly adhered to. The team member who checked me in assisted with the bookings.
Breakfast is served at Ash & Elm on the first floor. Once again, this hotel has adapted well to the present situation. Guests are asked to sanitise their hands whilst waiting in line, before being shown to their tables. A menu card is handed to you and one gets to chose one of four breakfast sets. Service rendered is impeccable. I love how Anne, the Director of Food & Beverage, introduced herself and said to call upon her if I needed anything during my stay.

we were here for for two nights for our 10th year wedding anniversary. i might have mentioned that in my online booking much earlier, because we received a cake one day post the day of the anniversary.
we truly appreciated the gesture. it’s a pleasant surprise to find the cake when we were back in room. On the other hand, we were somewhat disturbed because we turned on the “do not disturb” the entire time.
We wondered why the hotel staff went ahead to enter our room despite the sign, instead of calling to check and waited for us to be back in the room. As we really trusted that no one will enter the room when the sign is turned on, i began to wonder if this is taken seriously, not just for this hotel but every hotel.
Maybe this is one thing to take note :) nonetheless, thanks for the surprise.",Date of stay: November 2020,,4,,,,,,,,Dhoby Ghaut,,

InterContinental Singapore,mav68,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/mav68,"Singapore, Singapore",mav68 wrote a review Oct 2020,477 contributions,"Generally Good, more thoughtful process can be put in place","Chose this hotel for a staycation recently after trying out many other 5 star hotels in the city.
I parked my car at the basement carpark near to the hotel lift but only to find out that the lift was closed and the only access was through the Bugis Junction shopping mall. A communication via email during booking should be triggered to inform all the customers so they can make their own decision to drive r not to grab a car. It is not so conducive to carry your luggage (worse if you have a baby pram) to whiz through the basement carpark and up the escalator in a very high footfall shopping mall. It was quite a challenge. In addition, car park redemption is not available but a subsidy coupon sold at S$20 per day (per exit).
We checked in at 1.30pm, the room was available and the reception allowed us to check in instead of at 3pm their standard check in time. It was very kind of the gentlemen whom checked us in. We were assigned the Heritage Room, pretty spacious with some local ""Peranakan"" details as the hotel is part of the Bugis/Peranakan enclave. The room is located at 3rd floor (shophouses) overlooking the mall, and my room is overlooking the “food court” where there will be people perpetually staring in. For those who wants the privacy the curtain has to be drawn all the time and it makes the room pretty dark without the natural sunlight unless you turn on the light.
The room is considered quite spacious with 37 sqm, bright with the aids of lighting which was good as you may need to draw the curtain for your entire stay. A 4 features bathroom is part of the design which is pretty standard for 5 star hotel. Though the renovation was done not too long ago but the aging sign starts to appear particularly in the bathroom.
It is a Pet-Friendly Hotel, and on our floor there are a few ‘paws’ friends stayed next door. Though I love pets, but the barking at night can disturb your sleep. They should assign those rooms only to pets guests and move other guests away from it. More room allocation management has to be put in place.
The location of the hotel is second to none, sits above Bugs Junction linked directly to the MRT. The mall is also connected via linked bridge to Bugis+ ( another shopping mall) where there are lots of eatery outlets within the shopping malls and also the food streets around this precinct.
The most beautiful part of the hotel is the lobby lounge. Probably one of the nicest and grandeur in Singapore in my opinion. You can have afternoon tea or have a drink in the evening. The ambience is just so pleasant and having a drink over here is an indulgence. Highly recommended.
The breakfast is served a la carte, there are 4 choices for you to choose from. Decent and appropriate for a 5 star Hotel. The service was excellent, efficient, friendly and they really know their turf very well. Kudos to the team.
The service generally was pretty “Inter-Continental” throughout the hotel with the exception at the poolside. It was crowded over the weekend and the turnover was extremely high. The pool is not big nor they have sufficient sun loungers to go about. The pool attendant should be more diligent in clearing the use towels and water bottles but he was not in charge of this service apparently. I was observing throughout but he did not lift a finger to help. An hour later, I saw a chambermaid came out to clear the soiled towels instead. Not productive, this job has to be done by someone that is overseeing this section of the business. As the soiled towels were all over the place, the new guests would know which decks are available and many walked away thinking it was no-vacancy. This not only makes the poolside extremely messy, unsightly and also turned away many guests which in my opinion, deprived of their privilege to enjoy the swimming pool facilities.
In short, it was a great stay but as a IHG flagship brand, I would expect nothing less than what I have indicated.",Date of stay: October 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Dhoby Ghaut,,

From the start to the very end i dont find any enjoyment staying here.
We stay here for 3 Days 2 nights.
The moment we enter in this hotel, there is no one to escort us in and direct us to the counter, mind you, we came in quite late at 4.30 pm and definitely there is no one in the queue. My husband was carrying 3 luggage and 1 baby pram while i was carrying my baby, there is this staff, pass by us and just ask, "" Do you need help?"" What type of question is that?! My husband straight away say ""NO"", and she just walk off. I can't believe it!
Than comes the check in process. A guy by the name of Zulfadli attend us. Not even looking in the eye. Just proceed everything without explaining a clear instruction! I am not sure if he have a problem with us or what. We asked for an upgrade and we don't mind paying it, and his response was, '' Its fully booked "". I'm really curious, on weekdays and its is fully booked? Are you sure? And he is not even a smiling at us nor look at us. Is smile really expensive here in this hotel?!
For the room, there is nothing special to us. We have been to better hotels than this.
Breakfast, I'm not sure why only this place allow 1 set each person whereby other hotel s allow unlimited orders. Worst part, the first day of our breakfast, one of our breakfast did not reach to our table. Do we call for it? Nope. Whats the point.
Mind you, we are a frequebt ''Staycationer'', so we know what is service call like.
Overall, service here is terrible, and I guess they need to treat everyone equally. Its not that we stay here for free and we expect nothing much but a smile. We were soo disappointed that we check out much earlier than expected.
And the worst part, its our wedding anniversary.",Date of stay: October 2020,,1,,,,,,,,Dhoby Ghaut,,

Her stay at this hotel was miserable .To be more specific-
Upon check-in, she had clearly mentioned to the front desk staff that she is a Hindu-vegetarian. she was consistently served non-vegetarian food, in spite of never ordering it and constantly telling the staff that she is a vegetarian. One of the first times this happened, she was served beef (which was very saddening for her)! The staff were very flippant and unempathetic when she called them. When she objected to this and they finally agreed to replace it, they asked her to eat the side salad that had touched the beef dish. When she refused, they said that she would be served no side dish at all.
The first time beef was served to her , she would have overlooked it as an honest mistake. But the next day meat was again served to her. This happened to her a few times and she was nearly in tears.
Also did not expect that this five star hotel restricts its residents to a single tea bag a day? It was very cheap to constantly ask for tea bags from hotel staff, and so got our son-in-law and daughter to have them sent to her from outside. We found out later that people staying at other hotels (including Ibis (my son was staying /quarantined in hotel IBIS , almost same time, which is three stars) were just given a proper (and normal) tea-tray that consisted of tea-packets, coffee-packets, sugar and creamer.
It is given to understand that the Singapore government is actually subsidizing these hotels and providing them financial assistance by booking the entire hotel. Surely, if this is the case a basic service level should be maintained. The Intercontinental was clearly trying to cut down costs to the maximum extent possible, irrespective of how it mentally affected their guests.",Date of stay: August 2020,,2,,,,,,,,Dhoby Ghaut,,

I wish I had booked somewhere else in hindsight as there were a number of issues with this hotel.
On check-in the queues were so long they were out the door, there were no obvious signs of any management, the employees were running around aimlessly and taking over 10-15 mins minimum to check individuals in. I understand with Covid things are a little bit more hectic, but instead of staggering check-in times they opened the counter at 3pm and caused a rush of people and there were large crowds gathered in one area. I stood in this line for 1 hour before I could check-in for my friend, there was a pregnant lady left to stand in the queue and two women holding sleeping babies I found it completely unacceptable that they would be made to stand in queues for an hour.
I haven't stayed at this hotel before but as far as first impressions go, I was disappointed.
Once I managed to check- in it took less than 5 minutes, showing that 10-15 minutes was completely unnecessary. There was no cake in the room, a small issue I know but I had booked and organised this staycation over 5 weeks prior to the stay and i had emailed the reservation team and they had assured me it would all be taken care of. When I called reception to enquire about it, I wasn't told that it would be rectified or even an apology, I was told I had to show proof of my email before they could do anything-how rude! Also it came the next morning when they were due to check out, pointless!!
I have since been told they ordered room service at 11am and it only arrived at 2pm, one hour before they were due to check out and they couldn't finish it because they had no time to eat it. How on earth does it take 3 hours to cook 3 dishes??
I thought that staying at this hotel would be a wonderful experience and I was embarrassed at how bad it was. It's a 5 star hotel run like a 3 star. They are rammed and they are not prepared for it, the service is slow. We spent over $600 on the room alone not including food and i regret not spending this in another hotel.
I would not recommend this hotel for a staycation, you are just another body to them, these issues have nothing to do with covid otherwise I wouldn't be making this review.

As one of the Platinum Ambassador, had a free upgrade to another level of suite.
Somehow I feel that overall the hotel seems to have staff shortage issue.
Whenever we request for anything, it always take quite a long while before items were sent to the room. Sometimes I had to even call back to check how come the items are still not been sent.
As the intercontinental club lounge is closed, beeakfast, afternoon tea were served at Ash & Elm and evening cocktails over at the Lobby Lounge. The wait each time really needs improvement.
On one of the breakfast, there was even a strand of hair that I actually pulled out from the hash brown that I had put into my mouth. Immediately I told one of the staffs and appreciated that she offered to have the plate replaced and also the chef came over to apologised sincerely. I totally understand the tough job of all service staffs. Thus must really compliment most of the staffs are still putting on a smile despite been so busy.
Another disappointment was the sofa bed blanket was soiled and my daughter felt itchy after sleeping on it. I went to the front desk to request for change but after a long wait had to call the operator to check before they sent somebody to change it.
I had also requested for room cleaning but nobody came after 2 hours and I had to call for fresh towels because we were waiting to take our shower. When housekeeping sent over the towels, he saw the light for room cleaning was still turned on and asked if we wanted them to do it. That was already almost 3pm and we actually pressed on the roon cleaning since 1130am.
I would suggest there should be separate queue for club lounge guest and those who have no access. We all ended up having to join the long queue into Ash & Elm so what is the difference. Totally dont feel any the recognition of being in the ambassador club.

Room - room and bathroom were clean, was given a connecting room as requested and I appreciate that a thin mattress was placed in between the connecting doors to block out whatever noise. Love the toiletries!
Bed and Pillows - maybe I’m a fusspot but I had expected the bed to “engulf me” but it wasn’t soft enough for me and the pillows were too soft.
Breakfast - thanks to our dear Covid we weren’t able to have buffet for breakfast but we were able to choose from 4 different types of breakfast which were quite generously portioned and filling for a big eater like myself.
Lobby Lounge - had a few pints, pizza and beer. Pizza was good and the ambience was lovely.
Others - I had written in advance to inform the staff of my aunt’s and uncle’s wedding anniversary and they sent a cake which was a nice gesture.
Overall it’s been wonderful and will be back again!",Date of stay: October 2020,,4,,,,,,,,Dhoby Ghaut,,

Across the north bridge road, there are many hotpot, BBQ restaurants that open until mid-night. Room has started showing some signs of aging, like the sagging sofa and the rusted bathroom knob. However it is clean and spacious. The bedsheet is very smooth and comfortable, though the bed can be a bit too soft. The coffee machine is a plus. Staff are friendly and approachable, but lack of greetings that make one feel welcomed. Breakfast is complimentary, instead of a la carte buffet, it is served in set. Good quality but limited choice and portion might not be sufficient to big eaters. Club lounge is not available at this moment and suite guests…",Date of stay: October 2020,,4,,,,,,,,Dhoby Ghaut,,

I contacted the hotel to check if any additional arrangement or services can be made.
I was then referred to purchase their room decor package, however, I have already gotten my own decorations. Following which, the staff replied that they do not provide any thing else apart from their own room decor package. No other assistance or services offered.
I was rather taken back by their replies and definitely not what I was expecting from InterCont. Maybe I have set my standards too high but I was very disappointed.

The highlight was definitely the impeccable cleanliness of the room and exceptional service by Hotel Manager, Ms Joyce Chua. As someone who has worked for global hotel brands before, I was truly impressed by the cleanliness of the room - from the bed to the desk, to the curtains and the bathroom, tiles etc. I couldn't even find dust by the telephone which most housekeeping teams fail to clean unfortunately. Besides cleaning when the guest checked out of the room, great efforts must have been taken for a deep cleaning regime to maintain this level of cleanliness - I think only someone who has worked for hotels will know how much effort this takes, especially post COVID19 where the disinfecting process is stringent. For this, I must really commend the Housekeeping team for the great job!!!
Next was the presence of the Hotel Manager, Ms Joyce Chua. Though I have only stayed for one night, my husband and I seem to see her everywhere, at the front office reception area, lobby, exit, restaurant etc. The reason why we remember her was that she was smiling (with a mask on), greeting her guests and always ready to provide any assistance during our encounters with her. She could be seen talking to her team members to coach them as well. Joyce demonstrated exceptional service standards and is an excellent role model for her team members, being readily available for them. As I did not want to speak to anyone about my experience during my stay, I had to look Joyce up on the social network to gather her name and designation.
I would also like to thank Josiah, Yen Ling and Suhaisni from the Reception and Mae from Ash & Elm for the wonderful service experience.
I am extremely pleased with the overall experience I have received and will return to stay again :)",Date of stay: September 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Dhoby Ghaut,,

They also happily arranged for early check in and late check out, and even surprised us with a birthday cake and in-room amenities after we checked in. We had breakfast delivered to our room as room service and everything arrived promptly and like clockwork. The room was excellent, spacious and appeared recently renovated. Service staff routinely greeted me by name and acknowledged my loyalty on check-in, and accommodated our various requests promptly. The afternoon tea in the Lobby lounge was also excellent and included in our staycation package which was very good value. We also had board games delivered to our room, which provided a few hours of entertainment.
Overall, the staycation was excellent. The hotel could consider proactively providing evening turn-down service to refresh the bathroom, provide additional towels, and top up the coffee capsules etc. That said, these are relatively minor improvement points and do not detract from the overall excellent stay.

The breakfast, tea and evening cocktails were really good. I must really commend the staff at Ash and Elm - where the club lounge is currently squatting in - for always being kind, attentive and prompt even though they look rather short handed at times. They are continually bubbly and offering more stuff, and are genuinely disappointed when another portion of food/drink is declined. There are normally one to two staff who are really good, but over here, all of them are exceedingly outstanding. I can only remember Ann, Fiona and Mae’s names, but there were several gentlemen there too. It has got to be one of the best, if not the best, club lounge experiences I have had around the world.
There were some slight issues in the connecting room that was booked by my brother. Upon learning it, Kristen - the director of rooms - upgraded my family’s room for the rest of the nights even though my brother had checked out. She didn’t have to, but the gesture signified how serious the hotel was in service recovery. She also made the effort to check in with us on the new room on different occasions. Simply outstanding, and how the hospitality industry must aspire to be.
In all, my family and I enjoyed (and are still enjoying) our stay. It will certainly be at the top of our mind when considering our next staycation.",Date of stay: September 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Dhoby Ghaut,,

- Birthday cake when we enter the room still not there, which I informed during my reservation that it must be serve so my daughter will be surprise.

The tea tray was uniquely designed & pretty to look at but the food taste was a bit of let down. The ondeh ondeh cake & chendol dessert (perhaps the hotel own deconstructed version) is far from the Peranakan version :(
The scorn was not buttery enough!.
I was disappointed as i did not get to experience the high tea ""hype"".
I also ordered the classic margherita pizza from the ala carte menu & it turned out to be my favourite of the day.

The room was great size and spacious with two double beds for my 2 and 3 yr old and my partner and me and clean. Room service was not great and a high price.
We ate at the club room for breakfast which was a good spread but wish oat milk was available. We had afternoon tea, for 2 kids and 2 adults but only got two portions of afternoon tea so had to ask for more, the afternoon tea isn't actually afternoon tea it is a poor version of the afternoon tea served in the main room which I have photoed as there is a vast difference. The club membership is a con you don't actually get the full package that you would get if you just paid for afternoon tea in the main room. The cocktails and snacks, cocktails are amazing, snacks are just odd. For the cocktails and snacks we had to hunt down a staff member to serve us for this.
I made the mistake of booking directly with the Intercontinental Hotels Group over the phone and was given a price, and agreed and didn't check the confirmation email, the price was quoted in Singapore dollars. This was my mistake I have always booked via expedia or booking.com where the price you see is the price you pay, after calling Intercontinental 5 times and speaking to different people and constantly being told contradicting things which meant i missed cancelling the booking in the set time, they booked me a room where the price changes daily until you arrive and what ever price they quote that day is the price you have to pay regardless. So luckily my credit card had a big enough allowance as we sadly ended up paying TRIPLE the price i agreed to. Their call centre staff were incredible rude and cold. And from this experience despite happily staying in the London branch with no problems, it seems Singapore is the let down of the group and I would never stay here again.",Date of stay: January 2020,,2,,,,,,,,Dhoby Ghaut,,

Singapore, Australia/Tasmania and New Zealand should have been the itinary.
We broke our journey out from London as we always do in Singapore. We have stayed at this hotel in the past and find it very relaxing with attentive staff and wonderful food and drink. It is very representative of the great era of hotel building.
It is near but not on the harbour and lies in a relatively quiet section of the city. The time here refreshed us and we continued on our journey after a few days. From the 14th floor there is a wonderful view and we found the Club Lounge a wonderful experience with delightful canapés and staff who frankly spoiled us.
Following an eventful time in Australia and Tasmania, but alas not New Zealand, we returned to the Intercontinental again on our way home to London.
We were struck by the apparent increase in guest numbers including well behaved children and quickly discovered that this was in large part due to the Staycation breaks that the hotel was running.
Again we had a very relaxing time here, at least once our flight home had been confirmed.
We have grown very fond of the hotel, enjoying The Ash and Elm restaurant and the very impressive and comprehensive international breakfast offer. The breakfast coffee we thought in particular was excellent too.
Well done to all the staff, and hope to see you again soon.",Date of stay: March 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Dhoby Ghaut,,

And even though the 2nd floor suite balcony looks out to the bustling mall, the soundproofing was adequate when the doors are closed and i was feeling relaxed throughout. Breakfast team at Ash & Elm was superb. They were aware of my birthday and knew where to direct my companion when he arrived for breakfast with a cake.

We had booked the flash sale deal. This was great value but came with a penalty if you had to leave early. Unfortunately we had to leave two days early as countries were closing their borders due to Covid-19. When I explained our situation to Suhasini at reception she immediately waived any penalties. She was so helpful and friendly and so professional.

No regrets on being an Intercontinental member, as we always look forward to afternoon tea & evening cocktails at the Club lounge. This time, it was my toddler’s first stay with Intercontinental and we were relieved that we could still laze around at the lounge downstairs at a kid-friendly area while having our cocktails.
If you are looking for a home away from home, this hotel has it all. The beds were very comfortable and lazing at the lounge on a weekend is just perfect. I like the fact now that Club members get to choose breakfast items on a menu, on top of the high quality breakfast spread, this is new to us. As an IHG member, we had some time for my family to have a short dip in the pool before the late check-out which was very ideal.

I had the fortune to stay here recently twice. The service and staff are exemplary. It began with an hotel representative not just meeting us at baggage claim but he was standing there as we got off the jetway! What a wonderful way to become at ease arriving in a strange country. He of course escorted us all the way to the curb where we were whisked to the hotel in a fancy Mercedes. So first off I'd recommend everyone book their airport transfer.
We had a club suite both times and they bring you to the 2nd floor club lounge to check in. Very nice. Both of our suites were awesome with 2 bathrooms.
Club level is especially nice as a fantastic breakfast is included. And it's not a little continental thing like most hotels, no it was a full buffet. And we saved alot of money by going to the evening happy hour for free drinks and canapes. Didn't need dinner after that, not just cheese and crackers but gourmet hors d'oeuvres!
The staff was always friendly and helpful. Also, we were there as the corona virus outbreak began and they had hand sanitizer everywhere.
I did use the pool and gym and both are great.
Lastly, the location is great. Easy to walk everywhere or a short cab ride. Also, the big bus tour has a stop right next door.
There is another Intercontinental in Singapore but be sure you book the Middle Road location.

Here's what made our stay great:
- Ms Lucinda Neo was our GRM from the beginning, lucky to have such a kind, professional, genuinely guest oriented contact person.
I had some little issues that were solved within the day (scarce storage in room prompted an additional chest of drawers that just solved the problem, a malfunctioning door lock worked again till evening - Thanks, IT-lockmanager, very patient of you! -
All of these came along with an invitation to the inhouse Idlewild bar (phenomenal drinks & staff, particularly Hannif).
- Other good services: dry cleaning! Internet in rooms, perfect for even video calls.
- Also, we were able to leave one bag two weeks before our stay so didn't have to carry that along to the previous destination. The luggage was delivered to our room upon arrival at no additional cost. Our initial online request for bag keeping was addressed by the concierge team promptly, we were very happy with the service.

What a fab decision that was. Arriving at the hotel at 3am, hotel staff were fabulous at sorting payment for our taxi from the airport (the driver had advised he took credit card and when we got to the hotel, he didn't and I had no S$), with them organising for it to be charged to our room, so that we weren't stressing. We were promptly checked in and escorted to our room.
The Suite was stunning, offering a magnificent Singapore Skyline the following morning.
The Club Lounge was spectacular and without doubt the best lounge we have visited. Service, size of the lounge, decor, and food selections were fab. Complimentary High tea is served in the afternoon and was a lovely treat before our airport transfers. The lounge staff were also accommodating in allowing us to remain after checkout, before we transferred to the airport.
The Bell Desk were great at assisting with maps, taxis and recommendations. The hotel is less than 10 minutes to Gardens by the Bay and the Merlion and Riverfront areas. The Subway is one block from the Hotel, although we did not use.
The Lobby Bar was stunning and is a beautiful place for a drink or high tea.
Overall a Lux hotel, with Colonial Architecture and stunning Asian furnishings and artefacts; offerring impeccable service. We would definitely stay here again.",Date of stay: February 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Dhoby Ghaut,,

We upgraded to a club suite to enjoy the extra amenities offered. We were not disappointed! We had a wonderful stay! The service was outstanding, the rooms were spacious and well appointed, and the location was perfect for everything we wanted to do. We loved the food and service in the club.

Wasn't blown away","After our Holiday in Danang Intercontinental & Danang City by My Khe Beach, my husband and I decided to stop over in Singapore for an extended Valentines treat. Meet & Greet at the airport was fantastic, we were picked up by a Merc limousine, great driver, everything was perfect.
We then went to the Club lounge to have some drinks. Having visited Intercontinental Bali and Danang, the service we received here was just OK. Nothing special. The food in the club lounge was nothing special if I am honest. I had to ask for some hot canapes and they apologise for taking so long to serve it. I just asked because everywhere we went, IHG club lounge staff would always go around giving hot canapes to guests.
I must mention Mhelvin, we really had a nice chat and he made sure we had drinks. He actually made our night better.
Having spent New Years Eve @ IC Bali & Valentines Day in IC Danang, the customer service here at the Club Lounge is 5/10. Graeme is a Spire Elite Ambassador and was a Royal Ambassador and we didnt get treated like we were treated in the last 2 resorts. Maybe because IC Singapore is just a business hotel.

InterContinental Singapore,mistermark8,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/mistermark8,"Seoul, South Korea",mistermark8 wrote a review Feb 2020,79 contributions,Beautiful Rooms! Inconsistent Service!,"I wanted to bring up concerns and comment on my recent stay at the Intercontinental Singapore.
As an IHG Spire member, I was more than excited for my first trip to Singapore, and would be staying at the highly-regarded and reviewed Intercontinental Singapore.
First, I just wanted to give feedback on the quality of service was great when it was there. The check-in, room service, and also concierge and instant service. Also, the housekeep was very attentive during my stay and made sure my guests and I were comfortable throughout my stay.
However, there were inconsistencies in service throughout my stay which I just feel didn't meet my expectation and standard of excellence I am used to from the Intercontinental brand.
- Under my two bookings, for one room, I had requested an extra rollaway bed. I was told it would be prepared once I checked in. After check-in it wasn't there, so naturally I assumed they'd bring it in for turndown service. Before going out at night, I had noted it wasn't there, and told the front desk. They communicated they would deliver it at 9pm, and it would be ready before our arrival back. After a long night and day, I'd assume the bed would be there. However, upon our arrival at 2am, it wasn't there and we had to call again to have it set up. Although, it seems like a small situation, I had booked clients in that room, and at night when guests want to turn in, I think they'd hope to find a bed they requested 3 times. Also, if I was paying for the extra charge for that room, I'd hope it'd be there as well. I hope, we can take these extra things (especially if they're being charged) into detail for future guests and stays.
- I had two service incidents for breakfast. On my last day at check-out, approx. 10am., I wanted to enjoy breakfast before my flight back. I began at the Club Intercontinental Lounge, I arrived for breakfast hoping I would be greeted and shown a seat, as I was seeing with other guests coming in. However, to my dismay, I was lost in the process and had no one explain to me what was going on. From which, I proceeded to the lobby breakfast restaurant instead. I came to the restaurant and the host manager found me a table as I went for food. At the egg station, I had waited for almost 15 minutes and 5 guests for eggs, the cook had ignored my presence, although I made sure he knew I was there, since I was the only one left, and was about to take the order of the next female that came through. That's when I cut in again, and said my order. I communicated my egg order to him, in which he acknowledged and I left to get other food as other guests have done. Usually the egg process Is they leave eggs aside for the customers to come back. However, in my situation, it wasn't this case.. I came back to find out the cook was cooking new eggs for customers in front of him, and he looked at me and asked for my order again. I then proceeded to tell him that he took my order already and he's taking new orders without reserving mine. In ANY SITUATION, this would be ok. I understand how stressful and hard it could especially during a morning rush to forget. HOWEVER, I made it apparent and obvious I was there from beginning to start, and who I was and what I ordered. The only thing, I'm upset about is, I felt it was either racially or age-discriminated. During the order process, I felt he was only taking orders from older and non-Asian guests. Although, I was dressed more casually, my presence was known and from those 5 guests, 3 came after me and skipped me. I am very polite and try to keep things professional as I am a person that doesn't create loud situations. However, during that time, it made me feel inferior for no reason. I decided to just leave as his first response wasn't to apologize, it was just to start cooking the eggs. So, I decided to leave and told the host manager at the entrance, and expressed my concerns about the service inconsistency. This situation was embarrassing for me, because even when I returned to retrieve my eggs explaining to the cook how he skipped me and knew my order, other guests were watching the situation unfold. That's when I dismissed myself, because I was no longer comfortable in that establishment. I'm not commenting on this for the cook to get in trouble, but I believe there can be better anti-discriminatory training or recommendations. And, if that is not the case, I hope there can be a better system put in place for the breakfast spread, so maybe other guests may not feel uncomfortable as I did, who just want to enjoy a nice breakfast in the morning. The open kitchen concept, is wonderful, however with no actual queue for these kind of stations, it does leave guests waiting and lost on how to receive their order.
I apologize if these situations feel trivial, but I felt the need to comment on my stay. I expected so much from the Intercontinental Singapore and wanted to enjoy my first trip to Singapore. Although, it wasn't technically my first time in Singapore, this would be my first time in Singapore in over 20 years.
I do want to acknowledge the rooms and property were beautiful and had the colonial traditional charm I was looking for. My family used to live in Singapore in the black & white houses when I was a kid. Staying in similar architectural charms like the Intercontinental Singapore reminded me of my childhood, especially the Heritage Suite with all the details. Some staff were amazing and helpful, but the true stars were the housekeeping in the halls. I was greeted every time I walked past by any of the housekeeping staff, I found this service charming and these little touches made our stay better. I hope my comments can be helpful to the property, and also for the restaurant service.",Date of stay: December 2019,,3,,,,,,,,Dhoby Ghaut,,

We loved every minute of our stay. Even with a 4 month old we were made to feel very welcome. Having breakfast and afternoon tea in the club lounge and enjoying cocktails in the main bar.
The real point of difference is allowing travelers with children to enjoy the benefits of the club lounge away from the lounge. i.e As children are not allowed in the lounge for evening drinks you are still invited to have them in the main bar on the ground floor.
The service was great and always friendly. In a very competitive market I believe this genuine level of service makes the difference and I will continue to stay at Intercontinental properties for this reason.",Date of stay: February 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Dhoby Ghaut,,

At that time, I questioned the rationality for her accusation. Despite I rally my question, she remains defiant not at all friendly; primarily as it seems she has her white entitlement friends and have no regards to local nationality. I were disgusted being she is a local Singaporean and so am I, she immediately jumped to the accusation that my guest created the mess at the table without investigation. Hence when I queried her accusation, without consideration that I am their privileged Gold / Platinum IHG member, she got her duty manager to call the police and accuse that I creating a nuisance, Throughout the ordeal, I have deliberately seated with my guest in front of the hotel camera surveillance to showcase we were quiet and non defiant. It was clearly recorded that the IHG duty managers together with the supervisor at Idlewild insisted I am remain in captive while they called the police to check on me; as they think we created a nuisance despite we told them on our serious senior title professional tilte undertaking in our career. Also, I have many times insisted that we will be no interest to create the mess for the evening. However, the 3 of them just ignored me! This is totally disturbing! This is outright racial discrimination from fellow local immature managers on its own race. They shld be fired from the hotel! As a result when police came at 2am, they realised it was a boo boo by Intercontinental duty managers and have us released immediately. Hence, my strong advise to all guests, pls do not stay at this hotel property! If you are from the West, yes they may give you nice service. But is their hospitality service really bottom of their sincerity? Their work values are questionable! If you are Asian, stay away from this hotel! This hotel has serious wrong ethics! Terrible! They have serious racial discrimination problems. Obviously the duty managers are coward and did not provide us their names. But if the hotel leaders who read and take this seriously, pls check on who are the 2 duty managers that are on the evening shifit for13 Feb together with the lady supervisor at Idlewild.The 3 of them have disgraced your hotel brand for showing racial discrimination on handling our case, they need to be fired immediately!

This was our first trip to Singapore and we wanted a bit of luxury before we flew home. We arrived from London after flying all night and we were tired but the staff were wonderful. Our room wasn't ready as were got in very early. We were taken to the Club lounge and had breakfast and a nap. The staff were wonderful throughout our whole stay. The room was lovely and more than we expected. Loved the canapés and drinks in the evening. Have nothing bad to say about this lovely hotel and it's staff. Am planning another trip in November 2020 and will stop over again in Singapore and will stay here again.

After traveling to Singapore for work for 4 years, I now live here and got an opportunity for a staycation at the InterContinental since my parents were visiting from the US.
Yet again the InterContinental met and exceeded all expectations. It’s tremendously clean, sophisticated, and superbly well maintained. It is truly a 5-star hotel. To pair with the 5-star experience, the Club Lounge is the favorite part for my wife and I. We’ve made great friends with a number of the staff that still recognize us even after having been away for almost a year. They even remembered my usual breakfast order! Ain in the Club Lounge has taken amazing care of us for years and we were so happy to get the opportunity to have her welcome us back to our home away from home! This is exactly what makes us want to keep coming back here or recommending the hotel to friends and colleagues when they are in Singapore.
Thank you Ain for being an amazing host and taking such great care of my wife, myself, and my parents on their visit to Singapore. This was an absolutely unforgettable experience.",Date of stay: February 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Dhoby Ghaut,,

It is a beautiful hotel with lovely staff. It is refreshing, well air conditioned, beautiful lounge and lovely rooms. The only thing I would say is that it is quite large so it was quite a trek to get to our heritage room, but other than that it was honestly beautiful. The location is interesting - it is a close walk to Raffles but a little bit 'where am I?' - when we returned we stayed in Marina Bay area which did feel more central and closer to the CBD. Otherwise, to be slightly removed this hotel was great. One of the staff recommended going to the Chjimes which is close by and a really cool fun place to eat.

The bed is one of the best I ever slept in including a very well working AC and windows are well isolated facing the busy Middle Road/North Bridge Road.
Bathroom is in beige marble, clean and fresh with a rather small shower room and lemon scented amenities.
We had a buffet lunch at the restaurant Ash & Elm located in the hotel – highly recommended. Lots a salads, fresh bread, cold hors d'oeuvres and two different warm soups and a irresistible dessert table for approx. 28 SGD/person (20% discount if you’re an IHG member). If you want you can add a main course for additional 10 SGD
.
Haji Lane and Arab Street is just 750 meter away from the hotel (a must see) and don’t forget to pay a visit to the ATLAS Gin Bar on your way back – this famous bar (No. 8th in the world of best bars 2019) with more than 1.000 different kinds of gin and an interior that’s stunning and literally jaw dropping.
The Spectra light show outside Marina Bay Shoppes (for free – 15 mins long) is worth a visit – look at their website for the schedule. We were there 30 minutes in advance (for the 20.00 o’clock show) and the seating area (wooden deck) was already half full.

The staff are friendly and the common areas and rooms are nicely appointed. Nice lobby and common areas. But I never had a good night's sleep.
First night, went to the bathroom at 3am and the bathroom vanity was covered with dozens of ants, some near our toothbrushes. It was gross and I lost sleep looking around the room checking for additional ants. Avoid room 341.
I told the front desk later that morning (they did not seem too surprised) and they said they could change the room and move our luggage while we went out touring. When we came back, we were pleasantly surprised to find we were upgraded to a junior suite, although they forgot to move our roll-away.
Things were not pleasant for long. When night fell and things got quiet, I soon found out there is a periodic but perpetual rumble that could be heard from the bedroom. I was told the noise was from the service elevators (again the staff was not surprised). This, and the annoying strobe light from the smoke detector can keep you up. Avoid room 301 as well.
My schedule did not allow me to pack up and move again. The staff tried to make things up by giving me a discount, but lost sleep during a vacation is hard to make up for. It's not acceptable to have two rooms with issues from a 5 star hotel. If we simply had normal rooms, we would have had a great stay.",Date of stay: December 2019,,2,,,,,,,,Dhoby Ghaut,,

The location of the room for us was fine...however quite a distance from elevators, and included a set of stairs. Also the floor did not require room key security in the lift. Our room included Club Intercontinental access, which includes breakfast and evening drinks and nibbles. Both were fine if not very busy...but that is to be expected during the Xmas/New Year period. The swimming pool area had a few problems....guests ""reserving"" lounges for long periods of time when they were not there....lots of other guests missed out on seating. Unsupervised children running and jumping in to pool. I think a pool attendant is required. The hotel is close to the MRT, and short taxi rides to numerous shopping, dining areas.

I didn't take them up on this offer, but it was a nice touch.
The room was very nicely appointed. The room was quite, had good air conditioning, and a comfy bed. Of course there was the complimentary Conrad Singapore teddy bear and rubber ducky. A plate of fresh fruit and chocolates was also placed in the room.

Buffet breakfast usual variety. Happy with good coffee and eggs.

Room and bathroom both were very well organised. Its always about little details which make the room to be working or not. Is there really space for two people in the bathroom and luggage in the room. Size of the room is 40sqm which allows this.
There are so many things to try at breakfast. We both want different things to eat and luckily the variation is huge. Very well chosen articles and the quality was excellent. We'd a possibility to try breakfast at the Oscar's and also at the 4th floor lounge. If you can do the same then choose the Oscar's which offers so much more. Pool area is really nice. Lobby bar gin menu variation with nicely designed drinks is a thing which should be mentioned.
The hotel is well situated near several shopping centers and restaurants. It is a two minute walk to the Promenade MRT station. Still not in the middle of Orchard but everything is accessible by MRT or 10 SGD Grab drive.

Our guests were all very impressed by the elegance of the venue.
My fiance and I want to give a big thank you to Crescent, our catering sales manager. She was very professional and efficient in coordinating our wedding. Thanks to Crescent, everything from the food tasting to banquet hall decoration to room arrangement and payments went perfectly well. She was patient and accommodating to our requests and had our interest at heart. Crescent's customer service was both exemplary and extraordinary besides being highly competent and knowledgeable.
We would also like to thank the Chef Ku Keung from the highly-acclaimed Golden Peony Restaurant. My guests were delighted with the food that came out of the restaurant. Many of them remarked that the food was one of the best they have ever tasted in a wedding banquet.
My fiance and I would like to thank Silva, who coordinated the schedule for the actual day of the wedding. Silva is an incredibly level headed and competent manager. His experienced and calm and collected demeanor ensured that everything runs according to plan. Everything was perfect on our big day, and there were no mistakes at all.

We took the MRT train from Marina South Pier to the Promenade station where Conrad Centennial was located. Having the MRT station nearby was very convenient.
We got there before 11 AM and were pleasantly surprised that they allowed my husband and me to check-in early! Since we were staying only for one night, the early check-in allowed us to start our adventure right away.
Our room was on the 15th floor and it was very spacious and well appointed. We found a bowl of fresh fruits as well as two bottles of water on the table. The room’s large windows faced the Fountain of Wealth at Suntec City across the street. The bathroom was also very spacious with many amenities.
Our stay would’ve been perfect had it not been for the breakfast that took place in the lobby the following morning. We were told to go there because the restaurant was too full. We’ve have gladly waited for a table but that wasn’t a choice we had. It was bit awkward because lobby was not meant for people to eat there. The breakfast selections were also very, very, limited. On top of that, when we stepped away to get some food, another couple took our seats. It wasn’t the hotel’s fault, of course, but it did put a damper on our stay. As the Hilton Gold members, we were not used to eating in the lobby.
All in all, however, we had a wonderful time in Singapore and our stay at Conrad Centennial was very comfortable. Next time, we will stay longer to take in more sights.",Date of stay: December 2019,,5,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

Having last stayed here two years ago (and several times before) it was heartwarming to get such a warm and genuine welcome back from Michelle who heads the Executive Lounges and from her wonderful colleagues Gurley and Mark who are super people who combine great friendliness with amazing attentiveness. I should also mention Sami who quietly and efficiently was on hand at breakfast each morning. The room on floor 29 was extremely comfortable and quiet. The wonton soup on the seats outside Oscars makes for a great lunch. The Golden Peony restaurant provides genuine Chinese fare and we were grateful to our waitress for making recommendations. The swimming pool, gym and spa kept up the feel good factor. This was like a home from home - thanks again Michelle and your fabulous team.",Date of stay: January 2020,,5,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

As fate would have it the circumstances were evolving as events in China were moving at pace .However,on arrival we were welcomed kerbside by the concierge who took our luggage from us and had it transferred to the room.
The reception staff were delightful and very welcoming , the hotel is impressive and the decor is sumptuous without being overwhelming .
The restaurants provide a huge range of choices and one could actually use the Conrad as a resort for 4or5 days enjoying the facilities including the pool and executive lounge.
We have been very lucky and have traveled widely for vacations but the staff of the Conrad were without exception the most welcoming ,helpful ,pleasant proactive and responsive especially the team in the executive lounges that we have had the good fortune to encounter.
Regrettably, we were compelled cut short our stay and to return home as events as I mentioned earlier were careering out of kilter as one country after another was announcing that the cruise ships would be denied entry to their ports, if they had previously visited China or Hong Kong .
However Conrad Hilton Centennial Singapore ensured that although we were hugely disappointed by events our spirits were sustained with very fond memories of a all to short stay at this superb hotel . We are planning to find other Conrads and hopefully be able to stay longer.",Date of stay: February 2020,,5,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

Our arrival into Singapore was early morning and I wasn't expecting our room to be available, however, after checking into the lounge, we were informed our room would be ready in an hour or so and after a short wait, as promised, our room was available.Getting the room so early was very welcome, particularly after a long overnight flight.
The suite was very spacious and overlooked the Fountain of Wealth directly below us.
Location of the hotel is fine with many sights within walking distance with easy access to Singapore's excellent transport system.
We used the executive lounge on the top floor (there is apparently another at pool level) and it was very busy, however, we managed to get two seats and food was decent enough.
You don't get much hotel for your money in Singapore, and The Conrad is up there with most expensive in and around Marina Bay, however, the service and quality of the hotel probably justifies the rates paid.
It would have been nice to have managed to stay here a little longer, however, my itinerary wouldn't allow it but the Conrad was a great start to our protracted trip.",Date of stay: December 2019,,5,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

However the situation has changed: there are no longer Fairmont suite upgrade certificates now that Fairmont is under Accor, Fairmont has become stingy regarding upgrades even with guests with a lot more stays than us, no lounge access, no breakfast, and now it’s Fairmont which is starting to show its age. Meanwhile rooms at Conrad were renovated a couple of years ago. Despite this I was in the mood for trying something new for example Andaz Singapore but when looking at prices I realized that Conrad was nearly unbeatable so I booked there and did not regret it.
In our room upon arrival we had a nice welcome gift with the traditional Conrad teddy bear and also a gift box with several snacks.
I found the result of the renovations at Conrad to be very good. The furniture is fairly nice with marble tops on the furniture near the bed and below the TV, and the carpet in the room seems to have been refreshed. The bathroom has a stand-alone shower in the corner and a separate bathtub along with a dual vanity. Privacy sheers and curtains are operated from the panel by the bedside, although I would note that they left a non-negligible gap between the sofa and the windows specifically because of the bulky curtains which are on the entire length of the room, and the sofa is equally long; it might not have been the most efficient use of space.
Some people report waiting lines at Oscar’s restaurant for breakfast so a couple of mornings we made a point of going a bit early. The restaurant was fairly crowded, but going before 8am it was not too bad and we got a somewhat private table out of the way of guests walking to the buffet so it ended up being better than expectations. The buffet itself has a large selection and quality was on par with Conrad brand hotels in Asia. Fruit selection could probably be a bit better but hot choices were nice with noodle dishes, Indian dishes, grilled veggies, and a rotation of fried rice every day. However one day the shrimp fried rice did not actually have any shrimps so they could be a bit more generous in that regard. It’s not my thing, but some guests would probably enjoy the ice cream station for breakfast. Another morning we went down to breakfast at 8:30am and we saw the dreaded long queue to enter the restaurant so we went to the lounge instead. While we could enjoy a peaceful breakfast in one of the small separate rooms, we found the spread to be quite limited there, for example only one noodle dish and other warm items were standard and too western to our taste. One advantage of the lounge breakfast is that they offer sparkling wine in the morning unlike in the restaurant. Nowadays bubbly in the lounge for breakfast is getting harder to find so kudos to Conrad Singapore for still offering this perk which provides a more luxury experience.
The lounge also has free wine during the afternoon which very few Asian lounges have. Happy hour 6-8pm had good selection of food but considerably crowded. Unless you arrive early to get a seat in one of the small rooms with a table for two, you end up in the larger crowded room and sometimes even worse the only seats available were for a large table and two couples would have to share it by sitting together which is far from ideal.
Overall Conrad Singapore is not perfect but considering the price I found it to be great value for the money especially with newly refreshed rooms, decent breakfast, plus happy hour in the lounge. In any city of the world where a Courtyard hotel is close in price to a Conrad (at least for my dates), you know that Conrad is not overpriced. There are several luxury alternatives in Singapore such as Ritz Carlton and St.Regis but if Conrad is less than half the price, guests who are dissatisfied at Conrad are probably looking for something more upscale than Conrad, rather than being dissatisfied because Conrad would fail to deliver for the kind of hotel it’s supposed to be relative to the price they charge: premium, not luxury. I can highly recommend Conrad especially to Diamond guests who are aware that you get great value despite not scoring on the elusive suite upgrades at this property.",Date of stay: January 2020,,5,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

Found the overall experience very basic, definitely NOT 5 star!
From the beginning - luggage took nearly an hour to be brought upstairs to our room - would have been quicker doing this myself.
WiFi constantly cuts off - even though this is meant to be premium fast. Does not stay connected.
The lifts have the most irritating and annoying bell ringing noises Everytime they are approaching.
The food for breakfast is not great - no flavour or taste. I have travelled to many places and stayed in 3 star properties with better and tastier food choices.
The executive lounge on floor 31 is boring and basic, very small and limited breakfast choice here as well as the afternoon tea - you are better off at Oscars. Flat atmosphere.
The hotel is large and focus seems to be on quantity rather than quality.
Staff are ok but nothing amazing about service, quite robotic i think.
Room service - one day the room was not even cleaned and we had to call to ask why - they said the ‘privacy’ button was pressed - complete lie because it was in fact off.
Yes bags and water not replenished.
Also if u want to go for a cocktail or evening canapés u have to drink in the pool lounge and can’t take drinks by the pool ?!! Why?!!
No where to fill up bottles of water - u would expect this at a 5 star
Anybody who is Hilton honours gets the same privileges as luxury escapes offer so don’t waste ur money. It’s a complete CON
Go elsewhere - I’m sure u can find better quality and service elsewhere
I would say stay near gardens by the bay / marina bay sands area! Also Clark Quay was fun!

We really appreciated being upgraded to a suite as a result of our diamond status with Hilton. The breakfast at Oscars was more than delicious, with so many local and distant flavors.
However, one of the best parts of our experience came after our cruise. We got off the boat early one morning, and our flight back to the US was it until after midnight. So, we went back to the hotel without a reservation, and not only did they store our bags for the entire day, but late that evening they allowed us to shower in the spa facility before heading back to the airport.

It’s highly unfortunate that so called 5 star hotels that cost hundreds per night can’t attempt to meet even basic needs of guests.
The general manager sent a nice welcome letter to my room and the staff is great. Except at the retaursnt when the waiter is asking the Indian food chef, the chef looked so pissed. I don’t want that cooking for me anyway.
Amex is once again the MVP for me to give 100 free food credit so at least I can live on fries and cake at the hotel on that.

From the moment I walked in to the moment I walked out, the service and hospitality was faultless. I was assisted by Intan N. upon check in, surprisingly I was brought up to my room for check in despite the check in counter being available. After she promptly went through the details of checking in I asked for directions to the nearest food court. She was able to clearly direct me towards where I wanted to go, for those who have not been to the Suntec area, it can get pretty confusing to navigate!
The room was very spacious, the stand out feature for me was the wall length lounge along the window, it was relaxing to lay by the window watching the streets below. There was a small desk enough to do some brief work on the laptop and long bench along the wall with the TV for luggage and bags.
The bathroom was spacious with a separate shower and bath tub, plenty of space to hang any wet clothes or laundry. There was a complimentary toy bear and rubber duck branded with the hotel logo which was a nice touch!
I had buffet breakfast included with my room booking, there was a great selection of different types and nationalities of food, I was surprised to find a congee station available. I always left overfed and satisfied.
During my stay I approached the concierge staff as I had lost the microsd card from my GoPro somewhere in the room, I had requested if the housekeeping staff found it during the reset after my check out for it to be mailed to me, notes were made on the system and I was reassured if found it would be returned to me.
The next day a member of the concierge team knocked on my door with a team of housekeeping staff, they were going to search for the microsd card before my check out, luckily I had found it overnight but the gesture had me speechless.
On my last day of my stay I was gifted some local cakes from the concierge team and a hand written card, I still have the card to this day on my home office desk. I previously had a favourite hotel to stay in Singapore but now Conrad Continental has taken my top spot while visiting Singapore.

I would've loved it if they had a jacuzzi, but that's not a criticism.
The beds are probably the best hotel beds I've ever slept on and I prefer them to my own bed at home!!
The room service food was really good and well presented.
The stand-out feature though was the hotel's ability to handle breakfast seamlessly despite us staying over XMAS and tending to go for breakfast at peak time each morning. Each morning, there was a large over-flow room to handle the crowds, and as far as possible, they replicated the service/food of the main breakfast area.

The entire hotel looked pristine and clean. The executive lounge was beautiful. It is cleverly positioned on the corner of the hotel which means you get a different view from each window. Cocktails from 1800-2000, good selection of dishes hot and cold, alcoholic and non alcoholic drinks. We did have to ask for the air conditioning to be turned off as it was very cold, they accommodated this without question. The executive lounge…",Date of stay: January 2020,,5,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

Very nice touch to include the Christmas bear and duck toys for the kids. Given we had booked via Amex FHR program, fresh fruits and amenities were replenished regularly and we used the dinning credits for in room service, food was fantastic and amongst the best in room meals we’ve had. In term of breakfast, both the Executive Lounge and Oscar’s offer a wide selection of international cuisine and made to order dishes, services are prompt and they try to look after the young ones. In term of transport, the hotel is closely located to Promenade MRT station, however we mainly used taxi and Grab given the size of the travelling party. The room is clean, decent in size, and conveniently located next to the Suntec City where you can spent half a day with the range of shops and refreshed dining venues. Overall, it was a pleasant stay and we had found memories of the Hilton brand. Lastly, just want to thank front office manager Fatimah Noorali who went above and beyond to support our needs and made our stay enjoyable.",Date of stay: December 2019,,4,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

The service shown by the whole team was exemplary. We arrived late afternoon and check in was fast and the guy was brilliant. When we got to the room it had the most spectacular view across Marina Bay... a world beater! One of the sofas by the window had been made up for a child (so nicely done even a teddy bear on the pillow) so we called down in n case the room was allocated to another guest... five minutes later the duty manager was at the door apologising... and honestly this was not something to apologise for, we were happy to go to another room and not spoil a family’s lovely welcome! When we came back from supper a bottle of wine was delivered with a hand written note from Sha, the wonderful duty manager. That is truly world class, genuine service and I have that card on my desk to remind me and my team what great service is about. Apart from that, the hotel has great facilities... pool an gym are great, two lounges one casual by the pool and one more formal on the top floor.

It was a good experience. Not the same level of Conrad hospitality, like one I’ve received in Conrad Macau.
The check in was efficient and I didn’t have to wait long. The lobby is old but still grand. Love the digital key function being offered at this hotel. Have the best bed for all the hotels I’ve stayed in before.
Room:
We were upgraded during our stay. Thank you for that. The room was spacious and very clean with Merlion Lion view. However you don’t get the full view of Marina in this hotel due to the blockage of other buildings/hotels. On the plus side, it comes with automatic shades or blinds. Impressive.
Bathroom:
Double vanity bathroom. With a bath tub. However, there’s no bidet. Perhaps it is time to invest into one like most hotels in Japan would have.
Room Service:
Very good. Prompt and proper. They will ask you to call them to pick up the trolley once you’re done. They don’t recommend for you to leave it outside your door. However, I’ve waited for more than 1/2 hour just to get them to pick it up. Perhaps - they can work on the timelessness.
Location:
Very easy to access to Suntec City Mall/Convention. Lots of restaurants outside the hotel. You can walk to Merlion Lion statue within a good 15 mins. Less than 10 mins drive to Marina Bay Sands. Great location 👍🏻
Public Transportation:
I didn’t use the subway during my stay. There’s plenty of cabs outside the hotel or you can seek out concierge to help you call for one. I used Grab cars during my stay. It was more convenience for me since I can choose from variety of cars offered.
Bonus:
The digital keys function. It will unlock your room with a single touch on your phone via the Hilton app. The hotel will have to activate the function for you once you’ve checked in. Make sure you have downloaded the Hilton App. You can always rename your room to avoid from people knowing which room you’re staying in. You will be able to access the elevator with it too. Incase your phone battery is low, you can opt for the physical card from the receptionist at the Lobby. Hope this helps! Enjoy Singapore.",Date of stay: December 2019,,5,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

However, if hard beds are hell, then never ever stay here. I have been here since 23 December for a family reunion, and in that time I have had two nights of decent sleep - only because I used my painkillers, which I hate to do.
It seems impossible to talk to anyone in management, and the front line staff just keep adding extra soft doona-like pads, which exacerbate the problem, as they all collapse and I end up sleeping in a sagging but hard bed. Last night in desperation we removed a lot of it and added another foam pad that we purchased, and I got some sleep. The next morning, as we have each day, I begged them for a proper mattress topper. What a mistake!!! They put more useless padding which collapsed and dished, and made things worse. At 4.00am this morning I had had maybe two hours of pain filled sleep and was in tears. You would think a hotel of this size and so called excellence could have some proper plush mattresses, but no doubt in cost cutting measures they went for the hardest most durable ones. We've been through this problem so many times here, but this time even though we went and bought foam pads, we cannot beat the bed. And as for management? They simply do not care. Maybe it's a way to keep guest using their spa for massages. But probably it's some bean counter and uncaring senior management. No doubt someone will write a reply to this, blah blah blah.

I am focusing on negatives since TA now restricts only to 1500 characters!!
negatives:
1. Furniture- my wardrobe door got stuck and i got a cut trying to open it. also, safe wasn't working which is the first in my life.. which comes to my second point.
2. Service recovery- I went down and spoke to the front desk about these issues and she asked if i needed more plasters?! she called the manager, he asked me what he could do for me. i told him to just get it fixed though i would have appreciated if he asked if i needed a change of rooms. i am not one to ask for an upgrade whatsoever. i was only there for a wedding that night and would have politely declined anyway. at night i saw a bottle of red wine, chocolates and a card. i appreciate the gesture but sorry the recovery should be addressed on the spot. by the way, i only drink white wine so i left the red in the room.
I felt that there was no excuse that wardrobe and safe ain’t working because housekeeping would have surely noticed it. my brother’s room on the 15th floor had issues too with the wardrobe. My wife met the technician again and he said that the wardrobe cannot be closed all the way otherwise it’ll get stuck. Confused. Following that, I felt the manager addressed the problem but not how I felt.
All in all, i think everyone in hotel works hard to maintain a high standard of service but my experience was just average due to the reasons above.",Date of stay: December 2019,,3,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

We've traveled extensively around the world, but have never been to Singapore.
The hotel is conveniently located near shopping centers and public transportation. You will likely have to walk a bit to most areas, but there are plenty of indoor malls and passages that you can cut through in the area. It was also easy to book a Grab or taxi.
The rooms are comfortable and our corner king offered a great view of the Marina area. While you can't see the Marina Bay Sands directly due to a building in the way, you are able to get quite a nice view of the gardens and surrounding buildings. The beds are standard to Conrad hotels around the world and excellent for recovery after a long flight.
The concierge team was outstanding in helping me make restaurant reservations in advance of our trip, as well as providing recommendations. I would highly recommend reaching out to them before you arrive if you have any specific requests. They also kindly provided some complimentary fruits and snacks as it was our honeymoon.
Since I booked through Amex's Fine Hotels and Resorts program, we had breakfast included. There were two options for breakfast: a large dining room on the ground floor with plenty of buffet options, or a smaller cafe on the 4th floor near the pool. We tried both and recommend the ground floor for days when you are hungry and the 4th floor for days when you want quieter atmosphere.
We also used our Amex hotel credit for a couples massage at the spa, which was delightful. Highly recommend this because Singapore is extremely humid all the time and it gets tiring to walk around all day.
If we were to return to Singapore, we would definitely stay at the Conrad again. As a comparison, we went to the Marina Bay Sands to look around and found it to be way too crowded with people who are there because they want to be seen, not because they wanted to have a nice holiday.",Date of stay: November 2019,,5,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

Few hours later while we were in the room, they delivered a small gift for me with a hand written card to wish us a happy wedding anniversary. It was a small gesture but it's the thoughts that count. One thing i am not so satisfied was that we must book out swimming pool slots and it is onli once a day and 1 hr each. The restaurant food had limited choice too. The Sunroom actually have snacks and drinks for free but maybe due to covid, only drinks were being serve.",Date of stay: November 2020,,4,,,,,,,,Bugis,,

The facilities were new and great, and the room was comfortable. The service at Mr. Stork was bad and staff seems impatient and rude though. A lack of late check-out even on a weekday is really disappointing too. Note that, there is no complimentary parking too (the other similar hotels around the area do offer it by the way, so it would be great if you could negotiate something with Duo, especially so for staycations.)",Date of stay: November 2020,,4,,,,,,,,Bugis,,

It’s my first time went to this hotel.
Pro :
- Room is quite OK size (not too big, not too small)
- there’s nice comfortable seating area in the room
- nice sunset scenery and evening scenery
- Soundproof is really really excellent! Didn’t hear a single noise at all during our stay
- TV is good size with good channels.
- Breakfast is alright, quite tasty but they only limits us with one time order for main menu
- Sunroom has very good latte
- Service at the sunroom is really really friendly
- Food at the “Alley on 25” very nice, i really love the pork ribs and asparagus and the linguini seafood, ordered the pork ribs 3 times during my stay :))
Cons:
- too bad even though the food nice, the service at the Alley on 25, not very friendly and helpful... , i think they are overcrowded.,
- The hotel housekeeping service is really excellent!
- Swimming pool is quite small, it looks huge in the picture, but actually not so. During pandemic situations they limit 20 people for one hr, i did feel 20 a little bit too many for the size of the swimming pool, anyway, we decided to skip the pool.
- The pillow too soft for me, i asked for firmer pillow and they provided “very firm” pillow :)
- water pressure at the bathroom not strong enough
- There’s no car park complimentary for hotel guest.
Overall, it’s quite good stay. It’s very fine hotel design, nice building structure and very nice room.
Will recommend for staycation with family or friends.",Date of stay: November 2020,,4,,,,,,,,Bugis,,

For high tea set, only can expect some pink color theme on the food. There is nothing special for you to anticipate pertaining to the taste and presentation.

Andaz Singapore,Ms. ODmg,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/ms_odmg,,Ms. ODmg wrote a review 8 Nov,1 contribution,Two-night Staycation during Covid-19 Phase 2,"We booked our stay with Trip.com a week in advance, noting a request for early check-in and late check out. The day before the stay, we gave them a call to see if our requests were granted, and they advised us to call again the next day after 10am, as they were not sure if the current occupant of the space would be checking out early. When I did call the next day, no one was answering the phones until just before noon. When they did answer though, they said we could already check in as our room was ready :))
Upon arrival, we were of course cleared first with their COVID-19 SOP. I thought check-in would happen on the 25th floor as I read the lobby was there, but probably because of the COVID-19 measures, check-in procedures were completed at the ground floor. I indicated that it was our anniversary in our booking notes, so we received a small welcome package of their signature lotions, lip balms, and bath gels, as well as a nice card - only the card said HONEYMOON :))
Shortly after arriving in the room, we also received the refill of our minibar - it was part of the measures to minimise staff from constantly going back and forth guest rooms. I had to do a bit of maneuvering to fit all the new items in the fridge, but we made it work :) Other items that were replenished upon request was the coffee capsules, tea, and water bottles.
The swivel TV was really convenient, as we were able to comfortably watch from the bed and the corner lounge area while enjoying the 180degree view of the city. The only minor issue was that I expected the TV to be loaded with Netflix, but it only had cable channels. The hotel offered us HDMI cables, which we decided not to get anymore since we were only watching one thing during our stay in the evenings - the election coverage :))
I was a little concerned about the bathroom before we arrived, as I read reviews that the shower area was open and would splash all over the bathroom floor, so I was relieved to see a full glass door that kept the water pretty much confined in the shower. The separate toilet area also had floor-to-ceiling windows - number 1 and 2 with a view if that's your thing :)) If not, they had automatic wooden shutters to keep your business private. There was no hairdryer in our bathroom upon arrival, but we were easily able to request for one.
We spent our next two mornings at their breakfast buffet. The table on our first morning was a little small, but they seated us at a nice sunny area with big table space on the second morning. You can access the menu via a QR code, and make your requests to their buffet staff, who would bring your orders directly to your table - another COVID-19 measure. The food was good, although I felt the options were a little limited, again probably because of the COVID-19 situation.
The pool and the roof top bar, Mr. Stork, can only be enjoyed through reservations, so make sure to reserve as early as possible.
Overall we had a good two-day stay. The gentle daylight from the floor-to-ceiling windows was energising in the morning, which was really great for me as I have been having difficulty with my sleeping patterns lately. A small concern would be that there was some dust in the lounge area, under the sofa and the table, as well as the overhead lighting, which was rectified the next day when we requested housekeeping to go over it. I'm putting the mishaps (dusty lounge area, no one answering the phones sometimes) probably because of a lower amount of staff. All of them were polite and helpful though, particularly the buffet server who kept refilling our drinks every time he saw our glasses empty :))",Date of stay: November 2020,,4,,,,,,,,Bugis,,

They use a friendly FB messenger app for you to make reservations for the restaurants, pool as well as in room amenities. It’s quick and user friendly.
Don’t miss dining at 665 Degrees Fahrenheit. This steakhouse serves steak cooked to perfection and the truffle mushrooms were totally yummy. We also had the lychee rose sorbet that really end the meal nicely. Our waitress, Dana was one of the sweetest, she arranged for the most perfect table with a sunset view and always came to check on us to make sure our dinner was perfect. Her service was warm and delightful!
Weather during our stay was perfect for pool dips in Andaz infinity pool. Sunny, the pool attendant who served us was the most helpful and friendly.

Room was huge, with modern fittings that still manages to feel warm and cozy. Windows were floor to ceiling, overlooking the CBD area. This means you get breathtaking views of the Singapore skyline, be it day or night. Soak in the views - it really is a treat!
You get two TVs in the room - one in the lounge area and one in the bedroom. They are huge and with really sharp pictures. They don't really have smart TV integration though, so you will not be able to play your Youtube or Netflix videos. I brought my own Chromecast but that didn't work either due to Chromecast issues when connecting to hotel wi-fi networks. The TV in the lounge area had a great soundbar which provided a cinematic experience. You can also connect your own device to play your music.
The bathroom was huge! Almost as big as the room itself. There were two sinks, with a bathtub next to the window for more of the great views. It sounds weird, but stepping into the bathroom just brings about calm joy. Most bathrooms serve a practical purpose and are easily forgettable. But the spaciousness, natural light, and view makes this an experience in itself.
Breakfast spread was great. The dishes were tasty though not spectacular. You can have them ala-carte buffet style in the dining area, or have them serve it to your room (1 serving only). Some items are only served in the dining area, like the breakfast smoothie and freshly made detox juice drink.
We had great service throughout our stay. All the staff we encountered were courteous and friendly. They delivered a complimentary birthday cake to the room as it was my birthday, which was nice. Calling guest services, they answered almost immediately and were there to help with any requests.
Overall, it was such a lovely experience at Andaz. We actually felt sad to have to check out, and really wish we could stay longer. This stay was a really memorable one. We look forward to staying at Andaz again!",Date of stay: October 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Bugis,,

The hotel also recovered well from an issue with pre-booking of swimming pool, which turned a negative situation into a positive one.
Booked a suite for a Staycation with wife and 2-year old daughter, and were really looking forward to the room and pool.
One issue we had before our stay was the booking of the swimming pool 72-hours in advance. I had called the hotel on time but due to a lack of call management system and poor pass down between teams, I ended up at check-in not having a slot at the pool, which was such a disappointment. However, Scott from the hotel was incredibly proactive as he tracked and informed us about the real-time quota, and we were able to use the pool in the end due to his updates.
In the end, my small family had a very meaningful time at the hotel and it was one to remember.",Date of stay: October 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Bugis,,

While you can pre-book the swimming pool, you can't do it for the gym which has only capacity of 5 pax at any one time. It is troublesome to keep calling to check whether if the gym available. Even more troublesome to go down from room level, to change lift at Level 25, down to the front desk at Level 2, join the long queue behind guests who are checking-in to collect the access card to the gym, back to Level 25 to change life, then finally to the gym at Level 38.

The room rate was good and I was keen to visit the roof top bar. However, from just after arrival I realized we had chosen well. Our early checkin scheduled to allow safe distancing went smoothly. We arrived at our room on the 36th floor and the curtains opened automatically to reveal the view, just as advertised. It was stunning. The room was better than I expected. Solid doors and walls in the bathroom instead of glass. (Who wants to see their partner on the loo??) A Nespresso machine, free snacks and drinks in the bar fridge, USB ports, good tv channels and lovely bed. It was understated elegance, quality and functional .
Location is great. MRT is underneath as are many eateries and a few shops. Walk to Arab street in a couple of minutes. We also walked to Raffles and Suntec City.
On return the gentleman who checked us in, welcomed us back, by name and continued to greet us and ask if everything was ok each time we saw him. This was a great level of service especially when the hotel was quite busy. We have had much less in smaller hotels! One person can make all the difference.
Mr Stork on the roof was a fun experience. We sat on the padded floor of a teepee and had food and wine. Tables would be better for looking at the view though.
The bar on the 25th floor has a great happy hour deal from 3-8pm on Saturday and a fab view as do the restaurants. The breakfast was lovely and you can order as much as you can eat and it is served to you at the table. The hotel is very well managed in terms of COVID 19 precautions.",Date of stay: October 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Bugis,,

Check-in process was smooth since there weren’t many visitors coming in at that time. However, our stay was met with some unfortunate incidents.
We found a baby roach behind the kettle and requested for a change in room. Even so, we had to wait for a housekeeping person to validate our claim before they arrange for the change of room to happen. The process of changing room took us at least 30 mins of waiting around.
The hotel floor manager was apologetic and offered us a late check-out and we went for lunch. Subsequently, we discovered that the access cards to the new room given to us didn’t work and we had to wait again for them to send us new cards. When the new card came, they only gave us 1 (instead of 2 access card). We had to request (again) for another card. Thankfully, the new cards worked.
Another disappointment in our stay was when we discovered that the bath towels (all 3 that were provided in the room) were all stained or had hair on them. We requested for a change in bath towels. Again, that took 20-30 minutes to be replaced. There was also stain on the bedsheet.
Not really what we expected from Andaz Singapore - maybe we were extremely unlucky. Even though we were given early and late check-ins, these were a minimum to compensate for the time we had to spend waiting around.",Date of stay: October 2020,,2,,,,,,,,Bugis,,

I had plans for a big party in the Philippines but covid sadly happened. Nevertheless, Andaz made it memorable and special!
I have huge praises for the staff as they really try their best to make guests feel special. Carmen from reception is phenomenal! Since I booked 2 rooms, she gave us upgrades, same floor corner rooms, late checkout and personally delivered a special birthday gift for me to our room! She always greets us and knows our names. If Andaz management is reading this, please promote her!
The crew during breakfast are also exceptional! They work SO hard to serve the ala carte buffet and even make small talk with guests despite being so busy. Im sure its even busier now than the usual buffet where people just take their food. Breakfast is SO good! Luckily we were there for 5 days so we got to try almost the entire menu haha.
For my birthday dinner, we had it at 665F where views are spectacular! They were so nice to give our group a private room with amazing views. The 1.2kg steak was SO good!! I am not kidding, it is better than Bedrock or Cut by Wolfgang Puck! You must try it!
I am so impressed with Andaz' high level of customer service! I was sad I couldnt celebrate my bday with friends and family back home but im glad we chose Andaz! The beautiful Scandinavian slash Japanese styled rooms, the rainshower in the bathroom, the bed, the free minibar - all of these made our stay memorable. There were a few times though I dialled ""0"" thru the my room phone and no one answered but this was minor. You can also ask for help using FB messenger but I wish they also had real people to talk to in FB messenger (like Four Seasons in SG) instead of just automated bots.

Andaz Singapore,Okamotter,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/okamotter,"Singapore, Singapore",Okamotter wrote a review Oct 2020,1 contribution,The worst experience ever,"By far, the worst stay ever.
The experience at Andaz Singapore was the worst among any stay I had at hotels around the world.
I had originally booked the Studio Suite room since it was my wife's birthday, and wanted to present her a very special experience. When I checked in, the front had actually gave me an upgrade to the King Suite as a complimentary for the special occasion, which I was super grateful for.
But then it all started to just tumbled down. As I heard at the front desk that the weekend is very crowded, I had called to make reservations at the Bar Square for the happy hour. The operator had mentioned that they will confirm and get back to me asap, but that never happened. Though I did understood that it was probably busy, I didn't care much, and head downed for drinks with my fam.
When I got to the reception, apparently it was busy, and there was one guest waiting to get in in front of us. They were told to wait at the bench in front of the bar, and then we were told to wait at a sofa until they can confirm a seat for us. The first waiting group were guided to their seats, but we had to wait a bit more. 10 minutes later, there were more guests that came to the reception, and right in front of our eyes they were guided to a 4 people table. I went and complained that we were waiting before those guests, but the staff was just saying ""yes you must wait"". I got mad and repeated that we were told to wait until you can prepare a table, but you guided guests that came later than us. Then a different staff came and started arranging a counter seat that was for 2 people. I had to wait standing until the staff brought a random chair from somewhere and just made me sit. Apparently they just ""temporarily"" prepared a seat since we were complaining. And if we hadn't went to the staff that we were waiting, we would've probably been kept sitting at the sofa not being noticed. Though the happy hour itself, and the G&T was really good, the service we received was definitely not Andaz quality.
Then the worst comes later. After staying at the suite room, we ordered in-suite breakfast instead of heading down to the restaurant, since we were advised that since the busy weekend the restaurant would be crowded. We ordered at around 8:10-15am and was told that it will take about 30-45 min. Though waiting for 90 min we still did not have our food. I had called the operator many times, but no one answered, and after about 4-5 attempts and waiting for 10 minutes on that call for someone to pick up the phone, I was told that they will confirm the situation and callback. Then I waited for another 10-15 min, but no callback. By that time I was really angry and had called the operator again. This time a different staff answered, and I told her that I have been waiting for nearly 2 hours to get my breakfast, but haven't received it yet. I also had called previously which the operator told that they will call back, but have not received anything. This operator said she will confirm and call back in 5 min, which finally I got, but she informed me that it will take 20 more min to get my breakfast ready. That makes it nearly 2.5 hours of waiting for my breakfast. Not to mention I had a 6 year old waiting starving. What makes it worse is that by the time they brought the breakfast or at this time it became brunch, the food was cold. Overall we wasted 2.5 hours of just waiting to get cold food delivered, where we could've went out to dine without waiting.
So our stay at Andaz, which should have been a special moment for my wife's birthday, was ruined with unprofessional, unacceptable, and by far the most worst experience ever. I have been at different 5 star hotels, or even 4 stars where I had extraordinary experience, and expected this one to be the same, or even better, but my expectation was betrayed with every bad thing the hotel can do to us.",Date of stay: October 2020,,1,,,,,,,,Bugis,,

NO BATHTUB!,"Booked a staycation for an anniversary celebration. Grateful for an early check in at 11am. King bed city view room is of good size but didn’t come with a tub which was a disappointment. Was planning for a good soak. Very generous complimentary minibar with 8 cans/bottles of soft drinks and juices. Nepresso coffee, TWG tea bags, chips and KitKat were provided too. We had planned to use the jacuzzi but it was closed due to Covid. Pool is not exactly big and booking needed during this period. Guest relations gifted us a box of toiletries as an anniversary gift. Nice gesture there! Our room has a fantastic view, however, you may not get a “clear” view because the glass is affixed with a “dots” kinda shield (refer to the picture). As for breakfast, we tried several items and our favourites were waffles and kaya toast. The rest of the items were quite ordinary. The detox juice is so darn good though. We totally didn’t expect such quality siew mai and har gao to be served. Please change supplier! Also the wait staff should check the environment. My chair has a small piece of pizza probably dropped since last night and not cleaned. And they should serve the appropriate cutlery together with the food. For instance, they served the congee and soft boiled eggs without a spoon. Since the lift goes straight to the car park, we called up the operator to find out about express check out, to our surprise, she does not have a ready answer and had to call back. We did not get any call 10 mins later and we left dropping our key in the express check out box on level 25. Coaching much needed!!",Date of stay: October 2020,,4,,,,,,,,Bugis,,

It came with $100 F&B voucher and free breakfast. Breakfast was ala-carte but you could order what you wanted from the menu due to covid measures. Sunroom was available for complimentary coffee and tea and I had some me-time while the children napped.
Exceptional Service
We checked in at 2 pm and was greeted by Carmen Lim at Front Office. She was really friendly and engaged my daughter with some chit-chat. The kids was presented a goody bag with #oldschoolsingaporeansnacks and a story book about Andaz Hotel. Carmen was really warm and a delight to talk to. Upon hearing that I was celebrating my birthday, she upgraded us to level 37 which had a great view of the City Skyline. She also helped me with my dinner reservation at Alley@25. It was our first time at Andaz and I was wowed by her exceptional service and Going the Extra Mile (GEM).
The next surprise came at 630 pm. Carmen surprised us with some amenities. She knew that we were getting ready for dinner at 645 pm. The attention to detail was immaculate and I would like to commend her!
Dinner
Dinner was delicious at Alley@25. Xin Wen and Remon were a great help. We initially ordered some deep fried chicken wings for the children but Remon highlighted to us that these were midly spicy. It was nice of him to replace it with Chicken Karaage with Ikura sauce. That was delicious. We ordered an oven baked pizza and Barammundi From the Green Oven and some satay and a beef burger from Smoke and Pepper. Love the Fish. It was wrapped in Paper ‘Baking Sheet’ and the aroma was contained within the bag, Teochew styled?
You would think there were no more surprises but somehow the restaurant knew that I was celebrating my birthday too. They served us some delectable brownie with icecream dessert while we were waiting for the bill. Boy was I impressed with Andaz!!
Breakfast
There was an ala carte menu to choose from and the variety was adequate, considering their limitations to not be able to hold a buffet spread. The children enjoyed some chicken noodle soup and Vanilla Waffles with whipped cream. We had eggs in style and some dim sum. There were some smoothies and detox juices to choose from too. Staff were very prompt at helping us with our orders and our plates. Thank you!
Facilities
The gym was sufficient well equipped, with the treadmill overlooking the Padang and city skyline.
I booked the gym at checkin but thought that I could call later for the pool but it was booked in the evening. Thankfully, we got to reserve a slot the next morning.
The swimming pool was large enough for laps and overlooked our beautiful Singapore Flyer! Thanks Adrian, at the pool for offering to take some photos for my daughter and I.
If you have read till this section, would I recommend this hotel? Absolutely, I am not sure about the previous reviews from others but the room I was allocated was clean and the views were great!
The staff at Andaz wowed us and I was thankful that we decided on Andaz.
Would definitely recommend Andaz for its excellent hospitality. Was raving about it to my family.",Date of stay: October 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Bugis,,

4) New room had smoke detectors positioned right above the bed that would flash blinking red lights. Very bad for sleep, the staff helped to tape these up.

Drove there and parked at basement carpark and followed directions to andaz only to find we were actually in the office tower lobby. Quite a confusing layout on arrival. Found direct access to hotel lift lobby after exploring awhile. Staffs were dress rather casually which is cool for us. Rooms were situated from 26th floor onwards. From lobby you had to take the lift to 25th floor and then change to another lift to access your room. Great views both from the pool and our room. Bed was HUGE! Bose soundbar at bedside table was a great addition. We were offered complimentary minibar but it wasn’t stocked up and only a pack of almond chocolate was in it. Haha!
Now for some problems we experienced which affected the rating of our stay.
No complimentary parking. Expensive if you choose to park between 8am-6pm. We didn’t head out much cos that’s not what a staycation meant.
The water pressure in our room was very weak. I had to head home for a good shower. Reported to front desk and the guy came tried fixing it but still same problem. Maybe it’s just our room.
The pillows provided were really really soft. Didn’t had a good night sleep. Requested for extra pillow for the 2nd night.
Overall we enjoyed the stay and definitely will be back again for another staycation.
Thanks for the surprise birthday gifts from the friendly and attentive staff.

After speaking to them, I have a better understanding why the hotel have accepted my booking in the first place and then cancel it subsequently. Given the circumstances, the cancellation is probably beyond their control. However, I do feel the cancellation message could be better communicated so that guests will have a better understanding of the entire situation.

You have contributed significantly to make our stay much easier, happier and super comfortable, (even with no window opening to the outdoor; the windows are large and let the sun/day light enter the room aplenty, the rooms are spacious, the bed and pillows, a dream). A special thank you to Miss Grace Siow, Room Division Manager for your graciousness and understanding and Mr Muru In-Room Dining Manager, both for your generosity, and your kindness. You and your team showed us some of the highest quality of service delivery indeed with your true sense of hospitality and professionalism regardless of the situation. We didn't know about the JW Marriott before, and we now can recommend it, with no hesitation. We can easily imagine how great of an experience it can be during ""normal"" stays.

be luckier. Location-wise I can’t quite comment as we were sent here right after we left the terminal building but from the window in my room I can see Esplanade MRT station right across the street. The hotel is rather new itself as I heard and the room is spacious compared to other same level hotels. My room got a distant view of the Marina Bay. Mattress and pillows are great for me. Daily amenities are provided and for any extra requests all are attended to promptly by the friendly hotel staff. Though 3 meals are provided daily (due to SHN), we decide to venture a little more on their in-room dining menu and no regret!!! We ordered pizza and fries and Buffalo wings and all are sooooo scrumptious and authentic.

Overall the stay was good. Large windows allowed plenty of sunlight with great views overlooking the marina.
The FOH and BOH teams were professional and friendly in dealing with requests and queries.
Deliveries were always brought up to the room promptly.
Just a few issues:
1. There were blood stains on the pillow-case which was discovered only after a few days upon turning the pillow around.
2. The in-room chairs maybe ok for infrequent use by short-stay guests, but they were uncomfortable as the only seating option for work, dining and rest over a 2 week period.

The hotel was already well prepared with all the temperature checks etc. Check-in was smooth, balloons and cake, personalised note was made placed in the room after coming back from dinner.
My only main gripe was the framed art in the room, it's a bit scary to sleep facing it at night. Breakfast buffet spread the next morning seemed rather limited, not sure if that's the usual spread. The staff came over with a birthday cake again and sang a birthday song - only to my horror that the addressed me - 'Mandy/Wendy' and weren't sure of my name, likewise on the birthday card.

We were checked in early morning of 11 July after a long haul flight from Canada. Being seniors, we were both bushed and were glad to be able to have our SHN at this fantastic hotel. Upon check-in, we had asked for both of us to share a room for our 14 day stay. The staff agreed and we were whisked off to our assigned room. We found it a tad small and cramped for the two of us but were just too tired to highlight our situation to the staff - it was already 3.30 am and we badly needed to take a rest.
Other than the cramped room, we found the staff and service standard to be very good. Meals were also good and efficiently and promptly served like clockwork. We were also relieved to have our swab test done onsite at the Hotel which was so convenient and generally hassle-free.
Our main issue would be the room assigned to us. Seeing that we were a couple sharing a room for 14 days on SHN, it would have been great if we had been assigned a bigger room (I understand there’s a Premier Room which is larger) with more space to move around, to have our meals and generally ‘do our time’ in a more comfortable and spacious accommodation. After all, we weren’t permitted to even step out the door for 14 days and a small room added to the stress and feeling of being cooped up in a restricted space. Some feedback, food for thought for the management and check-in staff to chew on. Thank you!

While I wasn't able to leave this room and use the rest of the hotel's facilities, I am still very appreciative of the service and amenities available in the room itself. Reception always picked up promptly when I called to ask for assistance. Their free guest Wi-Fi is more than adequate. I absolutely loved having both a rain shower and a beautiful tub with temperature controls. The lighting, blinds, and curtain were all automated using the TV and I had a great view of the city up on the 9th floor. The room itself is spacious and though I was initially a little taken aback by the sheer number of mirrors available, I have grown fond enough of being able to see my reflection at so many different angles. There is plenty of storage space, a giant, comfy bed, and impressive soundproofing. I was also kindly delivered 3 meals a day while in quarantine and they were tasty, with a varied menu (from braised noodles and chicken rice to seared fish and roasted chicken). There was more than enough food, with snacks, drinks, and dessert served with every meal. I'm sure that under different circumstances, this would've been one of the best hotel stays I've ever enjoyed. Even so, I'd like to thank the staff for being so accommodating during this period because it has been the best possible scenario I could've imagined for a 14-day isolation.",Date of stay: July 2020,,5,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

Check-in as Silver Elite, check-out as Platinum, stay here for about 53 nights from 7-Apr till 30-May, been upgraded to larger premier king room with Marina Bay View, which is a common upgrade category for Platinum member

Housekeeping team leader Zora is extremely efficient, she is the first one manage to spot the weird odour from our bathroom, and manage to get rid of the smell by applying some magical spray (I didn’t voice out the odour issue since it’s not that strong and it’s bearable)

Requested for adjourning rooms for our family, but given x01 and x04. Didn’t realize until we’re opening the doors. It doesn’t make any sense why we’re issued x01 and x04.
We were then told to stay in x01 instead.
x01 had a sofa bed which is supposed to be extended for the 3rd person, but upon attempting you’ll quickly realize the sofa bed, already pushed to the edge touching the windows, cannot be fully deployed without moving the king bed, which is more challenging than one expects.
Most walls and doors are mirrored, which means very little places to hook your toiletry bag, towels or anything you need.
We were later moved to larger x14, which has an excellent view.
In x14, air-conditioning smelled of mold within 5 mins of turning it off. (Room has 2 units so tried to turn one off since feeling cold). Turned it back on immediately.
The iron holder in the closet was screwed to the top of the drawers so there isn’t any way for even my small carry on to open flat. I wonder if cheap motels in US have figured out to install the iron holders to the walls, why is JWM making it frustrating for customers.
Rain-shower in x14 was spraying water everywhere but decide to use the shower head instead as I really don’t want to move rooms again.

The lads at the club lounge were very cheerful, helpful and proactive. They have a strong sense of purpose and are constantly looking out for emptied plates or mingling with the guests.

Totally love this place, it just like a safe sanctuary to us during this period of time. Tight safety measures are taken for the Covid-19. Temperature taking at the main entrance and hand sanitizers are seen at almost every corner in the premises.
As Ambassador Elite Guests, we have spent most our time at the Executive Lounge. Good atmosphere and environment for both business and leisure, with good people and good food.
We have met many hospitable hotel staffs throughout our stay here. However there is a particular one that we are most impressed with and we think we should mention his name here to encourage him to keep up his good work and keep on shining. Although he is just a trainee, completing his practical training here at the hotel, Lionel positioned himself differently.
As a Junior Chef he would takes the initiatives to walk around and interact with guests, asking for feedback and offers personalised service to guests. Which is something very rare that we could see in a chef in hotels, especially when we are not (yet) a long stayer here.
I have noticed some special dishes been offered to long stayers and some known VIPs by some chefs at the breakfast (which is a norm nothing extra mile that they are doing) . It's just our short stay here, we do not expect anything special to be served but we didn't even have a chance to feedback anything and interact with any chefs just like we did with Lionel. This is how special he is even as a trainee without a permanent position here.
Just like the saying goes, the way to a man's heart is through his stomach...if only there were more Lionels in the hotel industry...I am sure all hotels will have more returning guests and loyal customers. We really hope to see Lionel again in our next stay here.",Date of stay: March 2020,,5,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

The restaurant staff was also my fav. They talked to us everyday like family. Checking to see if we were comfortable or if we needed anything. Ali made sure our breakfast was always perfect. He even helped me pack a to-go bag our last day. Raymond was such a friendly morning greeter as well. He always has a huge smile on his face. Melvin was a great host when we had hors . Chef Arjun always brought my son his favorite fruit jambu. Even if they were all out he would find it and even cut it up for Knox. Chef Niño Dante made us feel right at home like we were in his kitchen. Jian Jun always brought the kids chocolates for turn down service and let them pick wether they wanted dark or milk chocolate. So sweet!
Ramesh in room dining serviced us so well too. Not only did he bring our food but he surprised my kids with the coolest chocolates. He even became a tour guide and encouraged us to experience Singapore in an authentic way. He was so helpful! Plus he even brought us masks after finding out we couldn’t find any.
The girls at the top by the pool, bar and fitness center were SO friendly too! Any time I went to gym or sat by the pool, they immediately checked on me. They even opened the gym door and elevator door for me every time. Joanne Cheng from Guest Relations drew a cute Pikachu with a sweet message for my kids because they love Pokémon.

For this stay we used 700 club points to secure a Quality Room. We likewise requested an early check in which was easily approved.
We had been away from Singapore for ten years and I had no recollection of a JW Marriot hotel in Singapore. I was informed that the hotel opened under the new Marriot management in early 2016 which was just 3 years ago.
The hotel is quite a landmark in the South Beach area because it is just beside Suntec City and Raffles hotel and is surrounded by all the shopping and restaurant
facilities in Marina Bay. In fact the 20th floor room which was given to us directly
overlooks the rooftop of Suntec City with a view of the Marina Bay Sands hotel, the Esplanade and the Singapore flyer.
The hotel's lobby is long and narrow and I noticed right away the sparse seating area with an assortment of unique chairs. I later found out that the hotel is one of the two hotels in Singapore designed by famous French Designer Philippe Starck renowned for Ghost chair and other furniture pieces and accessories.
The painted cement floor reminded me of industrial factory floors painted with polyurethane paint.What is outstanding in the lobby are the unique decors such as the floating candles in the reception desk and the 7 m LED screen with psychedelic motion art at the entrance.
Prior to staying at this hotel we were at the Ritz Carlton Millenia and one thing we missed is the spaciousness of our Ritz Carlton room. Our 20th floor JW Marriot room which has a commanding view of the Marina area however was small.
It however has a modern sensor Japanese toilet that opens as soon as you enter the bath room area. The shower and bath tub were also sleek and modern.
Again inside our room is an aluminium­ rocking chair by Starck that is tucked under a slimline desk atop black-and-white circular-­patterned carpet.I have never encountered a rocking chair in any of the hotels we have stayed in and it might not be welcomed by business travellers who use the desk for work (imagine swaying and rocking while writing presentations and sending out emails).
One thing that you should definitely check out is the 18th floor infinity pool which is a highly instagramable place in the hotel.
Its proximity to all the shopping, dining and attractions in the area makes it a favorite for spending staycation specially to watch the fireworks on National Day and New Years eve.With the current rate of about C$375/night the hotel is quite expensive and a good use of our Marriot Vacation Club points.",Date of stay: March 2020,,4,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

Fairly pricey as well.
The entrance was impressive. Service was detailed and friendly. No issues there.
The room was however small and looked so minimalist white that if felt like an hospital room. The Japanese toilet that tries to clean you all the time was more annoying than satisfying.
The semi-roof top pool was not sexy at all. Old PRC auntie swimming in. Water all over. Dark. No music. No beat. Total was of time.
I decided to try the bars and restaurants. Virtually none of the F&B places are in the hotel (one tiny very unimpressive un -JW Marriott bar (Tonic) on the GF level near the lifts). I was directed to ""take the lift, go up one floor, take the bridge, go left, go down, go out, go right and you will find our many bars.... After getting lost twice and a bit annoyed, I went back to the bridge and asked two ladies who were working at one of the restaurant reception to guide me. They told me that both bars I was looking for where closed on Monday night. More importantly, there was a strong fish smell coming out of the place. I ran away and went to eat at Marina Bay.",Date of stay: January 2020,,2,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

And it fits up to the standard as I wish from a JW brand hotel. As the Marriott Tang Plaza is a bit outdated I would recommend this one as my new Marriott default hotel in Singapore. A bit stylish in design and has everything you need. Location is in the Suntec area so close by to everything. A bit of downside is the pool that seems to be a bit small. But I didn't have time for swimming anyway.

That said, I felt the hotel feel short in several key ways, vs. other alternatives I know of and have stayed in when visiting Singapore. The hotel is ‘styled to the max,’ but in the process, the public areas are not really terribly comfortable. The gym is substandard for a hotel of this price/class, and the rooftop pool area is very chopped up, the pool small.
My biggest concern here is the room itself. Many issues with the design and appointment. It seems sterile, the bathroom complex had so many design issues it was hard to list them (lack of storage, lack of outlet, difficult to navigate, etc.). No coffee maker, furniture not comfortable. Some folks might be ok with this room, but against standards of this class of hotel and in Singapore, very disappointing.
Overall, a good hotel, but disappointing, and there are many other much better choices, in my view.",Date of stay: February 2020,,3,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

The personnel is beating all previous service experiences I had. The exec lounge is great but on the low floor level (2). This is a little drawback from the 70th floor view of the Swiss. However, the JW Marriott exec lounge has a better suited in my opinion, bar area with giant screen conducive to great conversation. The swimming pool is just awesome at the 18th floor wit a breath taking view of Marina Bay and downtown SG. A little drawback is in the bathrooms. I tried 3 different room models and none had an electrical outlet in the bathroom. There is no 110V in the room altogether but te concierge quickly solved this issue by providing me with a converter.

I like the hotel - this is why I came back for the fourth or fifth time within 12 months.
I like #Singapore - this is why I extended my 6 nights stay for another couple of days.
What I don’t like, though, is to be treated as a fool. You guys had me for 630 ++ in a suite and when I extended, you had the audacity to ask for almost 250 more. Seriously? Have you been at capacity? Was there a huge conference? Was it that Singapore was sold out?
NO!!! The whole hospitality industry is bleeding and for another 2-3 months there will be no stopping because of the hype around this freaking virus. And how do you react to loyalty and the rare guests who extend? You screw them! Yes, there is no other word that describes it better. No discount. No vouchers. Nothing to say “thank you for sticking with us”. Your way of thanking is to increase the price by almost 40%.

We are on time of the check-in however our room is not ready thus they have given me a smaller room to just relax with my family.
Then our room was ready at 4pm, good thing that the birthday celebration is for the next day thus I still have time to decor the place.
The whole experience was good and love the CBD location.
This Oct 2020 we booked again the same room to celebrate a staycation with my family. Due to the pandemic, everything is now different. I need to do SafeEntry check-in, temperature reading etc.
The whole staffs are friendly specially Raymond who ask us how are we doing, gives free balloons to my 3 kids etc =)
Breakfast is super as well coz its not the usual buffet. Its a sit down and we choose our food. If the food is not enough then we can order some more. I like their portions and it still feels like a buffet w/o the hassle of standing up =)
I like their pool area too, everyday we swim which needs to pre book for 1 hour thus every swimming time, we cherish it alot =)
Overall I recommend highly this hotel coz the location is good as well in Tanjong Pagar, lots of restaurants, shopes, supermarkets and everything you can ask for.
I like the convenience of this place where we can eat authentic Korean food, later on Japanese food then do fast food =0
I went out 1 night and found out that there's an outdoor park that we can chill out so we did while eating our store bought ice cream =)
Nowadays everything is kind of slow due to the pandemic and no tourist but for us it makes us appreciate more how we love SG so much =)
By the way, only downside of this hotel is that the key cards sometimes works and sometimes don't work that we ended up stuck etc.

Being served Kek Lapis and water while waiting, we decided to approach Raymond to ask about our Silver exclusives from Hotels.com. He proactively brought us to a counter to be served immediately. This was when we were introduced to the exceptional Siti who from then on forth has been extremely helpful in more ways than one.
Although the silver exclusives privileges was something that she wasnt sure of, the service we received and the bonus benefits we were given outweigh whatever privilege there is out there. She was honest to inform us of the full occupancy and managed our expectations with regards to waiting time. We were told that waiting time might reach an hour but to compensate us, she provided us complimentary breakfast for the 2 mornings we were there. The 1-hour wait was made easy by the strategic location of the hotel. (100 am next door + 24 hrs NTUC opposite, there are also several bubble tea stores at Tanjong Pagar Plaza opposite)
After the check in, Siti assisted us in booking the gym which had a limited entry allowance. Our request for in-room service like a bucket of ice and glasses were also attended to immediately despite the full occupancy the hotel had.
A commendable mention is also due to the breakfast team including the chef, who was very generous and served with friendly Singaporean hospitality.
The icing on the cake was when we approached Siti again for a late checkout, as I needed some time to transfer some files on my laptop, I requested to have a 4 pm checkout, only to be pleasantly surprised with an allowance of up to 6 pm.
Overall, the experience at Amara Hotel, thanks to the outstanding staff that we interacted with is nothing short of amazing. Being a fellow Singaporean, we feel like there are our friends and even family. With a plethora of new boutique hotels that have sprung up lately, Amara Hotel has successfully retained its charm of being an older hotel with its large room area and exceptional staff.

First night there, call to feedback about the hot air-conditioning that the in room controller was useless. The hotel had sent a repairman up to look at the unit (in the ceiling) and the repairman had told me that the controller was indeed spoilt and that there was no way i could tune the air temperature myself. However, he had tuned the temperature in the air con system directly and the cold air should come through soon. On the second day, still no change to the air con; had requested to change rooms. The same problem persisted in the second room. The whole situation repeated itself with the hotel sending another repairman to the room to fix the air conditioning but in vain. To make matters worst, the fridge in the second room was not working. Overall rooms looked very tired and carpets felt like they had not been vacuumed or shampooed in a long time. There was also a musky smell in the hallways. While the hospitality at the hotel was acceptable, the hotel itself was such a let down. By the end of the week, being sick and tired of the poor conditions of the hotel, I decided to check out and change hotels and my good god what a world of difference. Would never recommend this hotel and will definitely not come back. Nothing of this hotel speaks of the Amara brand.

This is the same floor that the club lounge is situated. Firstly, this lounge is staffed by two lovely ladies who work alternate shifts. Both these ladies are a credit to the hotel and themselves. The service they provided was outstanding. I hope the hotel appreciates just how good these two are and rewards them appropriately. We had breakfast in the club lounge most mornings as the breakfast room for all the other guests on the ground floor was very busy and noisy. You could get meals cooked just for you that arrived hot, unlike the downstairs buffet.
Each evening the club lounge provides free cocktail and any other type of drink for free between 6pm and 8pm. These ladies prepare your drinks for you and bring them to your table. There is an extensive range of hot and cold snacks with a nice selection of cheeses and small cakes. They could not do enough for you and liked to chat to us about our day which made us feel at home.
Our room was let down by a very hard bed. Despite requesting a soft bed prior to arrival, it was like laying on concrete. After the first night we approached staff about the bed and they put a thin doona between the mattress and the bottom sheet. This made only a slight difference, so sleep was a problem for all 10 nights. The room had a large bathroom, with two showers, one over a bath and a rain shower in a separate stall. The rain shower was very enjoyable. Actual space in the bedroom was just average with not a lot of room to move about. This club room also had a free mini bar.
Reception staff were very polite and efficient. The hotel is conveniently situated right next door to a six storey shopping mall with a number of eating places.

Amara Singapore,TEC162,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/TEC162,,TEC162 wrote a review Jan 2020,62 contributions,Stay elsewhere,"My first time to stay here. And sharing some feedback:
THE GOOD:
1. Location- it is beside a mall with great dining options esp if you’re fond of Japanese cuisine. Bar-roque, a highly rated resto is located within the hotel premises. A lot of dining and shopping places are within walking distance.
2. Front Desk staff- generally friendly. THOMAS TAMwas extremely helpful.
THE BAD
1. Rooms- though spacious enough, it badly needed renovation. And it seems they have a housekeeping issue; our room was dusty. The hairdryer needs to be replaced/repaired bec the wire is starting to get exposed (see photos)
2. Cafe- staff are not as efficient, except for APPLE(?) who seemed to be the only one attending to the guests with urgency.
CHEW HENG at the egg station was quite rude. When I requested for an over easy, he sported a huge frown and was grunting all throughout, like he hated his job. The result was an overcooked egg and a ruined morning (mine!) I think he should be relegated at the back of the house.
3. Doorman- SUHARI was the epitome of rudeness. After checking out, we were at the hotel driveway waiting for a cab to bring us to the airport; we were standing on the carpet that was labeled Taxi. Then SUHARI told us that we had to wait at the mall entrance (beside the hotel). I told him that two nights prior, the doorman helped us hail a cab when we went out for dinner. He then raised his voice that it was the law, etc etc.
VERDICT: Though I absolutely love Thomas Tam, I would rather stay elsewhere",Date of stay: January 2020,,2,,,,,,,,Tanjong Pagar,,

Amazing Staff!,"Travelled with family, stayed December 2019. Disappointing rooms greeted us at the Amara Singapore. The rooms and corridors are really dated with damp, musty, mouldy smells. We made a mistake trusting reviews posted on Tripadvisor!
Raghu was very helpful and immediately attempted to rectify the problem by moving us a couple of times until we ended up in a 2 room apartment style suite in the smoking floor which was better but not clean! We don’t smoke but this room was better! All the rooms we saw had cleanliness issues. Wan Ting showed us the completely renovated rooms but we had to wait for availability.
We managed to only get one room, the hotel next door (Oasia Downtown) offered a much better rate for a similar room so we booked it and ended up staying at two hotels! If you must stay at the Amara Singapore, book the 6th floor rooms, they are amazing! Modern, wooden floors, flat screen TV (room on another floor had a box TV…!), automation, usb points, hi-tech toilet and a good layout. The hotel is aging, adding to it, an in-efficient cleaning department (our room wasn’t vacuumed in three days!).
If not for the amazing staff we would have given this hotel a 2 Star traveler rating! They really made our holiday stay awesome! The Amara is fortunate to have them. Shout out to Wan Ting, Raghu, Thomas and of course the best concierge ever... Raymond!, the pulse of the lobby, with the best activity options, including where to get the best iced Yuanyang!

First, the price. It is a moderately priced hotel that is comfortable and provides accommodation well beyond what you pay for. The rooms are well kept, comfortable, and well maintained.
Second, the service. I cannot compliment the staff enough on how well they treat their guests. We have small children and the staff engaged them, checked in on our son who was getting medical attention, and gave us an extra late checkout on our last day.

The reception staff, Ms. Eloise Hung patiently and effectively attended my request to have a sunrise facing room on my second and third days.
Concierge:
Mr. Raymond, the most senior Concierge, took every effort to make sure my needs were , from delivering some goods to another part of the city to finding a sauna facility nearby. As I was feeling quite unwell and needed a sauna to detox and recover.
Thanks, Raymond for your kind attention to check if I was better already. Recovering immediately after Sauna at the other hotel I regularly stay in Singapore.
Swimming & Spa:
The hotel has an outdoor swimming pool with quite nice seating area, though I did not try it this time.
Spa is run independently and payable.
It has no sauna facility.
With modern wellness need, as per suggested by Dr. Raymond Francis, sauna facility will become a household must have and soon be a big comeback thing.
Location:
It is close to MRT Tanjong Pagar station.
Opposite has a 24 hour FairPrice supermarket and many Korean restaurants nearby. Also the hotel is adjacent to the shopping mall AM100 which also has some Japanese restaurants and a Japanese supermarket, Donki Donki, operating till 12 midnight. Opposite to some local housing complex.
One thing I may suggest to improve is the service at the breakfast area. Too many people at the breakfast restaurant. Food selection is decently enough. Cooks and waiters seemed overwhelmed and overworked there. Less human interaction.
Also need a simple table signage to inform that the table is still or no longer occupied to avoid guests confusion.

The stay was very comfortable, the rooms clean, modern and are a great size, with more than enough space for two people. The location of the hotel was brilliant...we literally walked everywhere from the hotel. There are some very good places in that block for some authentic Asian cuisine.
The highlight of the hotel for me was meeting Raymond in the reception area. Raymond greeted us every day with such friendliness and enthusiasm. He was eager to help us with anything he possibly could, from choosing a location for celebrating New Year’s Eve to finding transport to take us to our next stop over in Malaysia. This is a man who goes above and beyond in his role...nothing was too much effort for him and it is evident that he genuinely wants all of the hotel guests to have a fabulous time on their vacation.

Initial impressions were good although our greeting at reception was a bit brusque.

A hello and welcome would have been nice first as we had been travelling for over 20 hours. It was good that they also did this daily at breakfast and also before I could use the gym. Our room was lovely but, as others have said, you are unable to use the bathroom without putting the electric blinds down first.

The hotel is beautifully appointed and the rooms luxurious - high ceilings and marble everything in the bathroom. The high ceilings made the room feel a lot more spacious and our large windows looked towards Canning Park.
We were advised on checkin that there was a wedding the following night but we didn't hear a thing so the noise did not disturb us. It is lovely to walk around the park in the early morning and it is very close to the MRT, Clarke Quay and the Singapura Mall.
But the standout for me was the service on the front desk. They diligently but respectfully took our temperatures on checkin and when we asked them to daily (due to the corona virus precautions). They helped with grab taxis and information but I was gobsmacked by the final act of service... I often leave things behind in a hotel room... chargers, glasses etc... things that are annoying but easy to replace. This time I left my set of keys which had keys on it that would have been hard to replace.
I wasn't exactly sure where I left them but when I opened my email after arriving home, there was an email from the hotel saying they had recovered my keys and would I like them sent on?
Never ever before had I encountered this attention to detail and such personalised service. A small fee and they were dispatched.

Now that we are in, the impression we had is the same or even better.
The location is within the city center, accessible by a few walks from both Fort Canning and Dhoby Gaut MRT stations. Despite the city location this hotel is tucked within the greens of the park giving you that peaceful and relaxing feel.
Check in was a breeze, i like the sit down-table kind of style, very personalized. Julian was attentive and thorough, he also took time to walk me through the amenities of the room, very good customer service.
The room is well divided, it has modern amenities with classic interiors. I really love the bathroom, very spacious with lots of natural light. Comfortable bed and pillows and the overall cleanliness is impeccable. Also love the Nespresso machine. Although there is no freezer in the bar fridge, Julian was kind enough to collect the ice cream we bought outside, stored it in their freezer and delivered it to our room later.
The only fault we can find were very minimal like the bathroom sink took a bit of time to drain and the 5sgd++ for an ice request without mentioning it at first.
Buffet breakfast is so so, nothing special just your usual hotel buffet breakfast.
I would also like to commend the precautionary measures they take against the corona virus by letting us fill up a form, take our temperature upon check in and before going in to the buffet breakfast restaurant.
Highly recommended 👍🏻 (don’t forget to come down for the free flow wine, prosecco and hors d’oeuvres from 6-7pm)",Date of stay: February 2020,,4,,,,,,,,Dhoby Ghaut,,

It came at a competitive price compared with the corporate hotels so perfect.
The room was excellent with everything we could need and a comfortable sleep. Breakfast gave a good choice of Western and Eastern choices.
Two pools which were always quiet. A pity the sun-beds don’t have mattresses
There is a restaurant for evening meals with the typical mix of meals.
A nice touch was the free guest drink between 6 and 7. Perhaps a member of staff could circulate and give guests an opportunity to ask questions about Singapore etc

Wonderful colonial building set in historic Fort Canning. Great location 10 min walk from Orchard Road and the MTR and 15 minutes walk through the park to Clarke Quay on the river. Very much a garden oasis in the middle of Singapore. I exercised regularly in the Park as well as the in house gym (lots of great kit).
We arrived about 2pm and checked in without a wait. Really nice room - feature is the bathroom at the window end of the room. Good lighting and storage. The two swimming pools are wonderful and manage a garden feel.
Service was excellent.
This is not a big chain hotel so less staff and the team multi tasks. Reception doubles as the concierge, as well as serving early evening drinks - and were very helpful. The complimentary early evening drinks in the residents lounge were a lovely touch.
We asked for bathrobes, additional hangers and help with a maintenance issue. The maintenance man brought the bathrobes and hangers and fixed the issue quickly!

We have also personally stayed in the hotel on several occasions both for holidays and work reasons.
The rooms and facilities are very pleasant, however the main reason we continue coming back to this location is the staff. The hotel staff are always very thoughtful, I always get the impression that they have carefully considered my request and done their best to acomodate it (even if sometimes the answer is no, in general it is clear they have clearly thought very hard about how/whether they could make it possible). Overall this makes the hotel a very relaxed place to deal with. Indeed I always think this is very readily apparent in the atmosphere of the place which feels quieter and less frenetic than the surrounding orchard road/city hall/clark quay districts of singapore.

I've had to cancel a planned trip in February due to some distressing personal circumstances. Given the advanced notice I thought I'd receive a more understanding response from the hotel. I understand there are cancellation rules with third party bookings but after asking to explore options and seeing if a solution could be reached (ie paying a cancellation fee etc) I then received a message that was a flat no they cannot help me at all and that I should 'keep my reservation'.
I think there should be exceptions in certain circumstances for unexpected situations.

Even though I drive around Singapore I was caught out when my GPS directed me via Coleman street up Canning Rise. But this road is now closed past the Registry of Marriage. You can only reach this hill top hotel in Canning Walk via Stamford Rd.
I'd booked via a booking portal and had been worried since the room was for friends, not a couple, as all the photos showed transparent glass bathrooms, some apparently with the bathtub in the actual bedroom.
However upon a speedy check in I was glad to find there were roman blinds separating the bathroom (renovated on the former balcony). Even so, the receptionist reminded me three times to close the blinds to the huge window as people can look straight in.
Though petite, the room was very nicely furnished with fresh coffee, ample desk space and plugs. A great night's sleep in the king bed!
Charming boutique hotel though reaching the reception area with lots of baggage is tricky as the lift from carpark entails stairs via an open terrace . Drop off luggage and guests at the main entrance first!",Date of stay: November 2019,,4,,,,,,,,Dhoby Ghaut,,

The room was amazing and beautiful and relaxing. The breakfast buffet was comprehensive. The staff were very nice, sometimes too nice. I felt like they wanted to make me happy even when they really weren't sure what they were saying: bad directions, strange consequences of questions asked. The setting is beautiful; the park is gorgeous. But that was one of the problems I had with the hotel, which they can't change obviously. The hotel is kind of isolated from things, which is saying something in a city like Singapore. It takes some time to get to the subway stations or to walk anywhere. So, there's nothing wrong with the hotel, and I'd stay there again, but I probably would probably try to get a hotel closer to the CBD.",Date of stay: December 2019,,4,,,,,,,,Dhoby Ghaut,,

Very quiet for Singapore, yet in the middle of the city. Good museums nearby (National Museum, Battle Box). Make sure to request a room facing the park on the 3rd floor. Less than 5 minutes walk to 3 different MRT (metro/underground) stations. 4/5 stars because breakfast buffet is adequate but not overwhelming. Nice seating outside. Pool is very nice, hardly used. Separate lap pool. Rooms are unusually well designed, minibar gets restocked. Room Service is very friendly and is very good. This is more of a honeymoon / holiday type of hotel, rather than business. They do have a lot of weddings - held on the city-facing side of the hotel. This is why you should request a room on the park-facing side. The relatively price is justifiable by the unique location in the park.",Date of stay: November 2019,,4,,,,,,,,Dhoby Ghaut,,

Came for the U2 concert, left with much much more, thanks to a series of fortunate events. We ended up being invited to preview chef Jeffrey Tan's Xmas Otak-otak Turkey. Considering otak-otak is a steamed fish cake, one would have thought fish and poultry don't mix. But his otak base was chicken with traditional otak spices and otak stuffing served with roast vegetables and potatoes. The turkey turned out extremely tender and moist, especially the breast, even the drumstick was not left behind.
The awesome turkey lunch came with the hotel's world class fish head curry served with crispy roti prata and briyani rice, pork pong teh, nyonya chap chye and a heaping mound of Singapore Hokkien Mee with oodles of prawns.

Loved the hotel. Former British colonial admin building, used also I think as Japanese army HQ during war. Set in park, surrounded by lush greenery, it has a lovely feeling of space, of being away from the bustle of the city yet everything is easily accessible. Literally on the door step of the fascinating Battle Box and a stone’s throw from the National Museum. Room was very comfortable with stunning bathroom, though had to close the blinds between the sleeping area and the bathroom, not sure who would appreciate having the toilet in plain view of the rest of the room? Breakfast was fine, slightly eclectic mix of western and Asian cuisines. Ate dinner there one night as torrential rain made going out again seem too daunting. Food was very good. I loved the swimming pool. Had it to myself two mornings in a row. Lovely to hear a cockerel crowing, he was strutting his stuff in the adjoining park. Absolutely all of the staff we encountered were very friendly and helpful, particularly those on reception. If I ever go back to Singapore I would definitely stay at the Hotel Fort Canning again.",Date of stay: November 2019,,5,,,,,,,,Dhoby Ghaut,,

The main bugbear was the dinner for 2 @ the salon, which was included in the package.
The restaurant staff seemed to be quite unprepared for us, even though I had corresponded with the reservation staff on the dinner when making the booking about 1.5 months prior to our anniversary.
The staff gave us a choice of a seat, kind of squashed beside the wall, neighboring another couple. The other choice was beside the glass door leading to the outdoor area.
We chose to sit beside the glass door. It was kind of a mistake, because the waiting staff used the glass door for their service. So the glass door kept opening & closing during our meal, & hot air came in.
One waiting staff couldn’t remember that my wife was having warm water, & she corrected him 5-6 times when he tried to refill her glass with cold water.
The waiting staff asked us for our choice of main, which was met with my blank look, because I had also corresponded this with the reservation staff. They subsequently said that they found my reservation details. It seems they got the details wrong. As I asked for steaks for my wife & myself in the reservation, but my wife ended up having fish for dinner.
I felt that our meal was slow, because 2 neighbouring tables who arrived later than us, were already 1/2 done with their meal, by the time our mains was served.
My wife & I asked for the dessert to be sent to our room, because it took us 1.5 hours to finish 2 appetizers and a main.
I felt quite disappointed, because I had envisaged a romantic dinner with my wife.
We had bothered to dress up for the occasion, when we arrived at the restaurant & saw the ambience, I was already thinking we looked way overdressed.
I was even googling other restaurants while we waited because I thought I wanted to savage the dinner, but decided against it since we had already paid for the package.
The waiting staff didn’t mistreat us or anything, it’s just that they seemed totally unprepared for us, perhaps there might have been a communication lapse between the reservation staff & restaurant staff.",Date of stay: November 2019,,3,,,,,,,,Dhoby Ghaut,,

But it’s the details that are lacking - the window blinds for external facing windows are fully opaque (no partially opaque second layer to allow light while minimising visibility). no bathrobes. table side lamp broke and dangling. evening canapés had a very small selection, were not regularly topped up, and was hosted in a very small sitting area (it was thus overcrowded). Brut and even wine glasses ran out early and were not replaced. breakfast the next morning was decent but lacklustre, in selection, effort and arrangement (eg no one took coffee orders.

Not very good accessibility . The nearest metro station is atleast a 10 minute walk. And it’s a steep uphill climb on the way back to the hotel. Not feasible if you’re travelling with elderly parents ( like we were ) or small children unless you’re willing to spend on taxis (very expensive ).
The breakfast spread was lovely and met the standards. The view is nothing to boast about. But evenings are nice and quiet and good for short walks around the campus.
Overall a good hotel but I wish it were closer to the MTR/bus stop or the hotel had offered complimentary buggie rides up and down the hill . Given a choice I would opt for a hotel with a better location. That’s why I give it 3/5 .",Date of stay: November 2019,,3,,,,,,,,Dhoby Ghaut,,

The colonial style building is really beautiful and well maintained. Check in was very personal and efficient. The room was quite small but had a nice decor. The toilet was spacious with a nice bath tub. Breakfast was alright - not a huge variety but passable. One thing though, maybe it’s the building being quite old, the rooms were not very sound proof. You could hear your neighbours shutting their doors all the time. Overall it was a nice stay, just that if you don’t drive, it isn’t easy to get there.

As other reviewers have pointed out, it’s not too far from the main attractions (though we mainly used taxis are we are quite jet-lagged!), yet it is so peaceful up here.
The room is very comfortable, though not too private as we were above the main entrance, and had to close the blinds whenever we were in the room as there is a public path facing the room!
One thing we weren’t aware of is how hilly the park is, so paths are steep, and there are lots of stairs, which was exhausting in the hot, humid weather.
The reception staff were absolutely excellent, and nothing was too much bother for them, and we particularly enjoyed the free wine and canapés between six and seven every evening.....something you don’t find in the larger chain hotels.
All in all, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here, and would recommend if you want to be close by but away from the noise.",Date of stay: October 2019,,4,,,,,,,,Dhoby Ghaut,,

We had a late flight out, and again - they granted a late checkout, as well as ongoing access to hotel facilities (pool, showers etc.). The lcoation of the hotel is delightful, as is it's charm.

Experience impeccable luxury in an urban oasis in the heart of the city."" This could not be further from the truth. This hotel is barely 2-3 stars on a good day. I've travel to Singapore frequently and I've never found a reason to write a review before, but this was an exception. I stayed in room 103 from 20/10/19 to 24/10/19 and this is what I found:
- Disgusting, stained, greasy bed head. Seriously filthy. Obviously never cleaned. See photo.
- Serious mould in the shower. See photo
- Broken doorstop. See photo
- Peeling wallpaper. See photo.
- Disgusting stains in the bathroom all around the toilet. Obviously does not get cleaned properly. What a joke. See photo.
- Outdoor furniture is useless - missing cushions so they are too uncomfortable to sit on. This is why you will never see guests using their private outdoor areas.
- Large coffee stain on the wall. It was as if someone has picked up an espresso and thrown it at the wall and cleaners simply couldn't be bothered to deal with it. See photo.
- A previous guests contact lens stuck to the floor. Do the cleaners bother to mop and sweep the floors at all? Also pillow down strewn across the floor behind the bath
- Bar staff will happily ignore you. They will stare at social media on their phones and let you find your own menu. Glassware is also cheap and something you'd find in a backpackers hostel.
I highly recommend staying at the Grand Park City Hall instead (it's close by and just over the hill). They have extremely clean rooms and great bar staff.",Date of stay: October 2019,,1,,,,,,,,Dhoby Ghaut,,

Booking through the website was easy, and when we needed to make an upgrade prior to our arrival, the staff was efficient and eager to help. Once we arrived, we had no idea how stunning the location is right next to Fort Canning Park. We felt that we were in an oasis inside bustling Singapore. The staff was able to accommodate an early check-in, and while we waited we had a delicious meal at the bar. We were personally shown to our room, where our bags were already waiting. There is happy hour every evening at 6pm with Prosecco, wine and appetizers. The rooms were impeccably clean, well-appointed, with views of Fort Canning Park. Buffet breakfast is extensive and delicious. Even after only one day there, the staff had my preferred coffee ready for me in the morning. The gym is large with every kind of equipment you could need. The two pools were clean with mineral water, and we usually had it to ourselves. It also happened to be my son's birthday, and they surprised him with a piece of cake (even when we had not mentioned the occasion). At checkout, the porter came promptly to take our bags for an early morning flight, and the staff called a taxi which was waiting for us. It was a perfect stay beginning to end, so much so that we extended our stay one more night. This will definitely be my go-to hotel the next time we are in Singapore. I have been in top-notch hotels around the world, but the service and accommodations of Hotel Fort Canning makes it the best I've experienced.

Our stay was so comfortable and enjoyable. Elegant decor, comfortable and luxurious. The staff were so polite and professional, everyone treated so nicely. Breakfast was delicious (try the eggs Benedict from the eggs station!) with a mixture of both Asian and western options. We did not manage to take a swim but the pool is chlorine free and filled with mineral water, which sounds great and non-hair-damaging. Beautiful heritage hotel in a site of historical importance. A very classy establishment that I would recommend to everyone.

Hotel Fort Canning,DCMIT1,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/DCMIT1,"Higham, United Kingdom",DCMIT1 wrote a review Sep 2019,602 contributions,"Mixed Feelings, Typical City Hotel Lacking Intimacy","Stayed at HFC for 3 nights before heading to Ubud and Sanur in Bali having not previously visited Sinapore but having stayed in a number of other countries and cities in Asia.
Arrived at HFC around 9am having previously emailed hotel for an early check-in for our two premiums rooms to be told they were fully booked the night before and therefore unlikely, but we still felt optimistic they might be able to arrange something on the day. Walked in to reception after ~20 hours travelling to find a single receptionist somewhat stressed and clearly stretched. Whilst polite, the greeting lacked intimacy, engagement and any level of support with the position being that our rooms would not be ready until 2pm, perhaps 3pm, and no offer or direction to any facilities or amenities. Having handed over our cases we were left to orient ourselves and after sitting in the lounge area for 30 minutes headed off to the National Museum of Singapore to run down the clock in an air-conditioned building 10 minutes walk from the hotel. We returned at around 13:30pm with one room being made available shortly after arrival and the other around 14:30pm. With latest check-out being 12pm I struggle to believe that any real attempt was made by Reception to arrange for Housekeeping to prioritise cleaning of the rooms facilitating earlier access. A disappointing experience!
Thereafter, mixed views as follows:-
* Large rooms for a city hotel with comfortable king size bedsand good size bath tub with separate shower cubicle for Premium Rooms
* Large floor-to-ceiling windows creating plenty of light however privacy becomes an issue given hotel overlooked by paths within the park - you find you are constantly drawing and opening the electric blinds to use the bathroom or change etc. On a positive, all blinds, lighting and air conditioning on electrically operated panels
* Great size bath tub and shower cubicle but only one sink in lobby between bedroom and bathroom with poor lighting
* Shampoo, conditioner and body wash provided in silly little bottles and appear to be rationed; own brand and not great - would expect better from a 5-star hotel
* Lovely location in Fort Canning Park but lots of steps to and from hotel though access/ egress via Fort Canning MRT does provide outside escalators for the uphill journey
* Extensive breakfast buffet, friendly staff, as are the Housekeeping staff, but as per above Reception staff lack intimacy or empathy
* Two complimentary bottles of water with mini bar prices being reasonable, e.g. Coke $4. This is in contrast with the bar prices that are extortionate with two small beers and one apple juice costing ~$36
* Effective air conditioning and whilst requiring key card to activate cools the room very quickly
With a bit more intimacy and a personal touch this could be a great hotel but for us the lack of these touches just made it feel like another typical city hotel; happy to take your money and treat you in a very transactional fashion. Perhaps this stems from efficiency driven by a mixed business and tourist clientele but our experience upon arrival would make it difficult to return, hence a rating of three and mixed feedback.",Date of stay: September 2019,,3,,,,,,,,Dhoby Ghaut,,

Orchard, Dobhy Gaut and the clubbing and night time happenings district ie. Clarke Quay. This is how unique the Hotel Fort Canning is.
My husband had picked this place due to the wonderful, responsive service he had received from the staff while planning for a birthday surprise for me. I was touched by the birthday cake slice and candle provided by the management, together with its other surprises it had.
Loved the little garden although I would have wished the haze did not have spoiled the day.
In terms of design of the room, maybe because I have experienced better ones, I will like to suggest my feedback hoping it will be more thoughtful in design the next time.
Love the bathtub, but perhaps because of the floor size of the room, I personally found it cramped walking between my bed to the washroom.
I do not like the idea of the floor near the bed surrounding to be wet and thus find the design not carefully thought.
Showering area and toilet was too cramped. Just felt area really cramped. Not enough power plugs for the hair dryer. Maybe I was not observant, but the nearest power plug I could find, was at the study table or near to other side of the bed.
While sleeping at night, we constantly heard water dripping but neither shower room or the taps had the water leaking, maybe it was coming from the air flow unit above the ceiling.
Overall experience because of the above, I could only comment average.
But trust me, the service by the staff is perhaps the second best I can get after the ones in Riz Carlton. Give yourself a pat on your shoulders.",Date of stay: September 2019,,3,,,,,,,,Dhoby Ghaut,,

The hotel was created to have a more residential feel to it. And it did. Although I can’t exactly put my finger on what it is that gives it that feel.
The hotel is located just behind the waterfront at Robertson Quay. There are numerous restaurants in the area as well as easy access to the MRT both at Fort Canning and Clarke Quay.
I booked a Club Intercontinental rate and was upgraded to a river view room. The room itself was quite small by Intercontinental standards but perfectly adequate. There was no desk but rather a wall mounted bench and a lounge chair around a circular table. It did the trick for a few hours’ work but not ideal as an office.
The bed was big and comfortable. Overall the room is modern, with contemporary design and fittings. This probably added to a more homely feel. Complimentary tea and coffee with kettle and coffee machine are provided as well as a hair dryer and iron/ironing board.
The wash basin is within the bedroom area to the side of the bed with a small partition. There is a separate shower cubicle and a separate toilet cubicle.
The Intercontinental lounge was a nice treat serving breakfast, high tea and evening canapés every day. All of great quality and with friendly, attentive staff.
The main breakfast is served at Marcelo, located on the ground floor of the hotel. Overall, it was good, but staff had a hard time keeping the hot options on the buffet hot and replenished. Other than that, there were plenty of hot and cold options both Asian and western. Staff were again attentive although kept quite busy by the constant flow of people.

It was a pretty small boutique hotel for the Intercontinental Hotel Group we visited so far.
We booked a Club Suite Room and upgraded to Quayside Suite. Which came with buffet breakfast, afternoon tea and evening cocktail.
A little disappointing at the beginning as we requested for a higher floor for the river view and also early check in.
We called a day earlier, the reservation confirmed and we went earlier to check in. During the check in, the receptionist told us that the room is not ready. We were ok with it as we could rest at the club lounge and have our afternoon tea. I reminded the lady at the front desk that we requested for higher floor.
When the room was ready, we went to the room. Room was very nice but the view was partially blocked by the building in front.
What is the point of upgrading to a better room with view by paying extra?
We complained and the hotel organised a higher floor for us but we have to wait for 3 hours. They also extended our check out time.
It was a comfortable little hotel by the river side. There are a lot of restaurants, bars around. We love this little pocket of Singapore.",Date of stay: March 2020,,4,,,,,,,,Tiong Bahru,,

The staff from the doorman to the front desk attendant were super pleasant and accommodating for a guest arriving at 1AM. The doorman escorted me all the way up to the front desk on the 4th floor. Then the front desk attendant greeted me and thanked me for having visited Singapore all while recognizing my Ambassador status and room preferences. I was given information on the hotel and most importantly on breakfast for later that morning knowing that I would be hungry as I missed dinner. I got up stairs and took a super relaxing shower under the massive rain shower shower head and slept so well in the super comfortable bed after making a hot cup of green tea. The next day I enjoy WONDERFUL meal at the restaurant on the first floor and had a speedy checkout by a super friendly front desk attendant that took the time to review my bill making sure all credits and prepayments I had made were applied. I wish I had of had a few more days at this great hotel.
Note however that the rooms are small. Sort of like in a Tokyo hotel. Which was OK for me because I was alone, but if you are with someone... the bath and bedroom is essentially one room with some well positioned sliders to section things off.
I didn’t take many photos, but I did post a video of the room to Instagram - crecasens4

Everything from the club room, the food and drink and the club staff has been spectacular. The main thing that has really stood out for my partner and I is the staff and their service. They have been very accomodating, friendly and have certainly made our stay feel special, relaxing and enjoyable. We would like to thank Bala and Shella in the club lounge, they have served us throughout our whole stay and they have provided us with wonderful service. As soon as we walk in the door they greet us with a smile and ask how our day or evening was. They always check if we are okay, ask us if we enjoy our food or if we want anymore drinks. They have even remembered the simple things, such as drink orders from the previous day and offer us the same drink. Little things like that make such a difference, it really makes us feel really important and made us feel as if we belonged here.
Another staff member we would like to mention is Samuel, I believe he is the bellboy. His service was amazing and has really stood out to us, he always greets us with a smile and also helped us out with figuring out how to get around the city. He also told us about the Grab app, which was really helpful and thoughtful!
These three staff members have really made our stay special and memorable, we only have one more night here to go and we really don’t want to leave cause we love it here! It has been our home away from home.
We will not hesitate to come back here again!

Their club / lounge facilities are decent, with a good spread over breakfast, afternoon high tea (feels very hainanese / singaporean with the pandan cake addition to high tea), evening canapes and a 2-hour all you can drink (beer / wine / spirits / cocktails) offerings. The lounge has a balcony area with outdoor fans that at night provided some really good views over Singapore.
Club staff were really friendly and always talked to their customers providing any suggestions on places to eat, things to see, their experiences with your home country etc - thank you especially to Bala, Shella and others in the club lounge for looking after us!
In room - two different club rooms were chosen, one as a twin and the other as a studio. The studio is definitely a two person only couples room and the size difference between the club studio and the club twin was very clear between the rooms. The rooms were both good however the wifi connection from the club twin room was patchy the closer you got to the window (perhaps having routers or boosters per room or a few rooms would have helped keep the wifi connection working).
Overall - enjoyed the hotel stay and experience even though it's a bus ride out to Orchard Road and many other SG attractions. Definitely go for club access if you can.",Date of stay: December 2019,,4,,,,,,,,Tiong Bahru,,

It is my recommendation for a hotel in Singapore if you are not staying at the Raffles.
My husband booked the Robertson location seeing that it was new and wanting to give it a shot. However we switched after 1 night. Part of the issue is that the hotel is poorly designed and constructed. Although we were in an executive suite it felt claustrophobic (bathroom was spacious however and well laid out). The gym and spa is not in the hotel but in another building, 2 elevator away across the road and 2 escalators up. The lobby/entrance is non existent and your room access requires riding 2 elevators. The club lounge is also a disappointment reminds me of a Hilton or Marriott. During our stay the elevators to the rooms broke down (both elevators). This has been an issue since their opening. This meant that you had to line up to use the service elevator. Long waits.
The only saving grace is the staff. The manager all the way down to the bell boy is trying so hard to make this hotel a proper intercontinental in terms of service. Unfortunately the design of the building has ruined it.

I had high expectations and was not at all disappointed.
The rooms are a bit small, but everything functioned well. The bathroom/wash area is part of the small foyer when entering the room. There is no working desk but a small round table beside the window with a small bench on the wall one can sit on to work at the table. There is a big armchair which actually they could get rid of and put in something more functional to make more space. But the bed was comfortable and the TV is huge. All the basic amenities were available including a Nespresso machine with good choice of pods, refrigerate stacked with variety of drinks, a security safe, etc.
Breakfast is at the adjoining restaurant (Marcelo's I believe), and has a decent selection of food options. There are so many good restaurants and bars in the area to choose from if one needs to find a place to eat for lunch or dinner.
Location is great, so I was able to walk around Robertson Quay and Clark Quay for my early morning exercise, which has a wonderful ambience along the river at that hour.

The hotel is beautiful and different from what we have seen in other Intercontinental properties. But we loved it very much.
The service in the hotel Club Lounge was outstanding. Thank you Bala for taking care of us. My family really appreciated.
The hotel offered us a much needed late check out so my wife could enjoy a treatment in the Spa too. We used the hotel Brasserie near the river and the food was very delicious.",Date of stay: December 2019,,5,,,,,,,,Tiong Bahru,,

We were always welcomed by a friendly face. The concierge were eager to give us ideas as to where to eat and what to do. In particular, Rozaiman gave us fantastic dinner recommendations and went above and beyond to make our trip memorable. We opted for the breakfast option at Marcello, and it was very convenient and we consistently received excellent service from all the staff.
The location of this hotel is wonderful as it is quite close to restaurants along Robertson Quay and Clarke Quay, and is close walking distance to some charming coffee shops.
The hotel itself is beautiful, and I would definitely recommend staying here if you’re planning a trip to Singapore!",Date of stay: January 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Tiong Bahru,,

Vivek was very dedicated in providing amazing customer service.
He was present during my check in process, which was totally out of professionalism.
His colleague who completed the check in process was incompetent and it was also proved that she was a “liar” in the presence of director Rafael Adam on 27th Dec around 1 pm. Her service was so pedestrian that Vivek, who was a witness to this, requested me not to escalate it.
I was so impressed with his approach – although we are in a selfish era, in such a highly competitive & compelling environment, Vivek requested me not to escalate about his colleague and that he would talk to the management. It reflects on Vivek’s excellent upbringing and his formative years in school. This is the only reason, I am not mentioning her name.

We wished we could have stayed longer. The hotel rolled out its red carpet for us right from our very first entrance into the grand establishment till we checked out. We were warmly greeted by the Front Office Team; Ms Hui Yi & Mr Hong Yi, who acknowledged us as a loyal IHG Gold Elite member. It was also our honour to be graciously welcomed by the hotel’s Director of Guest Services, Mr Rafael. For our 2D1N stay, we received a complimentary upgrade from Club Intercontinental Studio to Quayside Suite (Room 639) due to my husband’s IHG status & since it was my birthday. What a great start to my birthday celebration! 👏🏼
The hotel truly lives up to its name as a luxury 5 star hotel with its contemporary & cosmopolitan design. The suite’s luxurious interior suited our taste that we immensely fell in love with its every detail. The open concept bathroom fitted with a tub complimented the suite with a romantic ambience. As it was my special day, our suite was beautifully decorated with colourful balloons, towels crafted into a cake & a personalised birthday card from the Front Desk Team. 🤗
From high tea to cocktail hour to breakfast, our tummies were delighted with good standard & spread of food. In short, we were well fed. The team at the Club; Ms Simran, Mr Hilmi, Mr Surya, Ms Sophie & Ms Elina ensured that our needs were met accordingly & that we were comfortable in our seats. They would take time to chat with us briefly & were always wearing a smile. Occasionally, Mr Rafael would pop by & chat with us too! Thank you for the Teh Tarik!
I was gifted delicious tiramisu cakes; one in the suite delivered by the team & another during the high tea along with a birthday song by Ms Simran & Mr Hilmi. We also received christmas goodies at our door. It was a surprise after another. We have to say that this hotel is way so generous. 🤗
To sum up, this hotel has far exceeded our expectation & I am elated that my husband has made the right decision to celebrate my special day at Intercontinental Robertson Quay. To the hotel & its team, thank you for the impeccable guest experience & the beautiful moment spent will be forever be etched in our memories. We hope you will continue to deliver impactful services to your guests, just like we have received ours. ✨✨✨",Date of stay: December 2019,,5,,,,,,,,Tiong Bahru,,

3) I have to take TWO lifts to reach my room, which means the waiting time is TOO LONG
4) Staff very condescending and rude when questions are asked
5) Restaurant quality are very poor. Breakfast spread is not the usual Intercontinental standard. Asian food at breakfast is pathetic.
6) Many taxi drivers have never heard of this hotel, that means they even save money on promotion
7) Bed room too cold, even at 25C. When i changed to 26C, the aircon stops working.
8) The swimming pool is pathetic and is not heated even though it has not direct sun access! Meaning, they do not intend for guests to swim...

Location is great to the river and restaurants. Was fed so well in the club that there is no need to venture out.
Small minus point might be the checkin staff can look happier and the weighing scale battery need a change.
Overall a fantastic stay. Glad we choose Intercontinental Robertson Quay. Stay the club room, we loved it.

Spending one week per month this really is my home away from home. What really makes this a special place to stay is the people. I’m extremely well looked after here and feel very much part of the Intercon family. The lounge in my opinion has to be one of the best in Asia. The team - Bala, Shirley, Vivek, Thines, Elina, Pauline, Suriya and Sophie could not do more for me during a stay. Whether it’s making dinner reservations, mixing a fabulous cocktail, sorting out a hire car or just simply stopping by to say hello and have a chat they truly are an exceptional team and congratulations to the management who clearly put a lot of emphasis on customer service and engagement.

Great location, great service, great rooms.","Stayed for a week at the Intercontinental, Robertson Quay at the start of December (2019) and cannot find any fault whatsoever.
Arrived very early on Sunday morning, not feeling great due to 20 hours of travelling and a bug i think I picked up on the way. Check-in was great - unsurprisingly our room wasn't available at 8am but they gave us a temporary room so we could shower and lie down. Felt much better after that and managed a walk around the local area while we waited for our room.
Got our proper room at about 2pm. Compact but very nicely decorated and well designed given the size restrictions. As a couple we didn't mind the openness of the room but it could be an issue with non-couples sharing (but the room separator resolves most of the privacy issue).
Very comfortable bed. Excellent air conditioning (quiet). Fantastic walk-in shower with the all important water pressure being more than powerful enough. Decent sized shower gel and shampoo bottles too (always replaced after housekeeping visits - good turn down service from house keeping). Good coffee and tea making facilities (Nespresso and a good selection of tea-bags). Quick service when calling down for fresh milk (or ice).
The hotel's common areas are great too. Very comfortable and clean and with a quiet and chilled-out atmosphere.
Enjoyed using the pool and gym most days. Both are relatively small but so is the hotel (by Intercontinental standards) so there was never an issue with overcrowding - in fact I had the pool and/or the gym to myself most of the time.
The absolute highlight was the Club Intercontinental Lounge though. Breakfast, afternoon tea and cocktail hours were all great. The thing that really made it standout though was the staff. Without fail - super friendly, happy and just generally brilliant at their jobs. I have to mention Sophie, Thines and Shirley especially - they looked after us so well.",Date of stay: December 2019,,5,,,,,,,,Tiong Bahru,,

This one by far has been my favorite. The staff was exemplary. I felt like I was a guest at a family member's home. Although I was thousands of miles away from home, that is how warm and at home they made me feel. The lounge staff went above and beyond my expectations. They were often very busy with a full lounge during the evening hours and I never felt ignored. I would watch them, and they made sure they treated each and every guest with the utmost courtesy and respect. They were all so accommodating making sure that no one went without anything they wanted or needed. I did not catch everyone's names, but some that stood out to me were Bal, Sophie and Thines. I instantly connected with them due to the way they approached me and spoke with me. Every time they would see me, they would greet me with such happiness and a sweet smile. They would take the time to have a little conversation with me as their way of making me feel special. I don't know how else to show my gratitude to these fine folks and their equally wonderful colleagues in the Club Intercontinental lounge other than to write this review. Thines, thank you especially for making sure I was taken care of with the wonderful Gimlet on my last day.

This hotel I believe set itself apart in my opinion when it comes to the customer Service and attention to detail from the staff. They are extremely welcoming, courteous, polite and in true fashion...Anticipate their guests' needs and go above and beyond to ensure the guests have a pleasant stay. Bala, Sophie, Sarah and Shirley were amongst the wonderful staff who catered to my sisters and I. They would remember your name and your requests and anticipate what you want and go out of their way to accommodate you, not that we needed much. They would listen attentively and make recommendations based on your ask and would follow up to ensure those recommendations panned out for you. With staff like these folks I would come back any day the opportunity arises. The Room Service teams, be it cleaning or maintenance was equally as wonderful and special thanks to Lin for your care.

InterContinental Singapore Robertson Quay,forknbeans,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/forknbeans,"New York City, New York",forknbeans wrote a review Nov 2019,69 contributions,Top Notch Customer Care by the staff,"General:
We came to Singapore as part of our 1st anniversary celebration, staying in Singapore for 3 nights. We stayed at a Quayside Suite King room on the 6th floor (wished we gotten a higher floor room...). While the room isn't as large as what we would expect from a ""suite"", it is very well laid out and appointed. Every bit of space was thought through and utilized. General basics are spot on, including great water pressure, fast hot water, 110 outlets by the sink, etc.
A few minor things that were off/odd:
1. Power lets are generally plentiful except near the sink/bathroom area (there was one in the hallway, but it is loose...I left message at the front desk, but wasn't fixed by the end of my stay, so I ended up doing it by the bed).
2. Doors to the toilet and shower are glass and with the lighting, there is very little privacy to the bathroom unless you pull out the sliding doors to shut out the entire bathroom (which makes the room feel smaller). Would be better if those glass doors are one-way or semi-opaque.
The best part...the staff..
1. The staff at this hotel is VERY well trained and VERY customer-centric. After the first morning at the lounge, all the staff were able to remember us and address us by our names. Very impressive and personal. Sophie and Elina greeted us each morning and was able to even remember our coffee selection.
2. Sophie (who was servicing the lounge) not only tended to our breakfast and various breaks, but also chatted with us and gotten to know what we are looking to do around town. Then she helped us with plotting out our sightseeing plans! This level of personal attention is something I rarely see in my travels, often in top level 5* hotels. It was personal without being overbearing; very sincere.
Without any hesitation I would recommend this hotel to my friends and colleagues. The staff service and attitude are absolutely amazing and should be the standard for other top end hotels.",Date of stay: October 2019,,5,,,,,,,,Tiong Bahru,,

However we felt a change of location was required this time, and something a bit special for an anniversary weekend. Despite some concerns from other reviewers on room size and layout we opted for the new Intercontinental at Robertson Quay. It did not disappoint. Check in was friendly and efficient. If you are considering booking one of the club rooms, the club lounge staff are outstanding. Nothing is too much trouble. The only restaurant we tried was Publico - meals were qood quality and adequate portions, drinks a bit pricey (even for Singapore) and service good. Now to the rooms - the open plan layout is a little unusual but I very quickly warmed to it. For international travellers, all power outlets are multi-standard. My adaptors never came out of the suitcase! If I was travelling on business, I would probably not be too happy with the absence of a proper desk. And yes, it is a bit on the small side, but space is used very efficiently. Overall, very satisfied and will return",Date of stay: October 2019,,5,,,,,,,,Tiong Bahru,,

Take the lift to the fourth floor where the reception counter and lifts to the rooms are. As it was the Hindu Festival of Lights, the lobby area had two types of Indian crackers for guests to savour and enjoy. A Rangoli design was also displayed, made by the staff. Both were pleasant touches to celebrate the festival and definitely made me feel at home.
I liked the room type I was assigned to. The room was comfortable and well designed and all the basic room amenities were available. I did have trouble syncing my mobile device to the soundbar though, but it did not bother me much as after all, I would not be in the room long enough to enjoy the music at length. Perhaps it was the instructions that were hard to comprehend, or the batteries that were weak. The bed was certainly very comfortable with plenty of pillows and electrical sockets were dotted along the walls of the room.
I did find time for a dip in the pool. The water was a tad cold due to the weather, and I longed for it to be heated. It was not a deep pool, considering that I saw kids and adults enjoying it whilst I was staying there.
The service rendered by Crystal (I think that is her name) at the front desk was great. She checked me in as well as out the next day. Being an IHG member, I loved the recognition accorded to me. I feel that this is so important in ensuring loyalty programme members are appreciated.",Date of stay: October 2019,,5,,,,,,,,Tiong Bahru,,

There were so many positive encounters with the staff and I would like to mention a few who made my stay such a memorable one.
Ms Kim who checked me in. I had problems logging into the wifi. She immediately offer to assist me. Rusardi who is always polite and engaging. He thoroughly explained the processes to exit the car park when he issued me a complimentary parking ticket. I invited some friends over to Marcello since it was my friend's wedding anniversary and her husband's birthday. Made arrangement with Sophie with deliver the cake. The tiramisu recommended was absolutely delicious. During breakfast, everyone was quick to response to my needs especially Chloe and Yeeling, who are attentive. My partner was late for his breakfast and Chloe went above and beyond by requesting me order for him so the chef can prepare ahead so he does not missed his breakfast. That's what a call to serve with PASSION. Fiqah & Rafael from the InterContinental Club. I bumped into Rafael when I was dining with my friends (celebrating birthday & wedding anniversary) at Marcello. When he found out the occasion, he wished them and invited them for a drink at the Club. Needless to say both my friends were very happy and impressed.

Excellent suite with nice Scandinavian themed decor, awesome mattress, floor to ceiling windows, spacious bathroom, bathtub with a view and a nice infinity pool. Early check-in was smooth and front desk staff Mr. Ibrahim was friendly, polite and efficient.
Only reason to rate 4 was mainly because of limited vegetarian food options. We personally prefer to eat freshly cooked vegetables, noodles, breads, rice etc. than mock meats like fish and chips, and burgers that were available at the Lime restaurant. We even asked the in-room dining service to see if they can provide vegetarian curry instead of butter chicken which they had in the set menu but they were not willing to accommodate to our request. Our choice was limited to select only few available items so we could not use the 30% discount on F&B and ended up eating at restaurants with different vegetarian cuisines nearby. I believe there is no demand for vegetarian food at the Lime restaurant and I understand it’s hard to attend to everyone’s needs in the current situation so we are cool about it. One of the male staff serving with grey suit at the Lime restaurant was grumpy and cold. His body language made us feel unwelcoming as he just kept the food in our table and walked away like we were never there on both the days during breakfast. It is not something that you would expect in a five star hotel but I will give him the benefit of doubt due to current situation. However, the other staffs were excellent and the service was fast.
We would definitely prefer to stay again at this hotel to try their other suites and dine outside.
Overall, we are satisfied with our stay and looking forward to explore other Pan Pacific hotels.",Date of stay: November 2020,,4,,,,,,,,Chinatown,,

This is a common sight in most Singapore hotels between 2 to 4 pm. The team did their best in trying to manage the queue but it just kept getting longer all the way to the driveway. Safe distancing was a concern for some of the guest in the queue. Nevertheless, the service was Top notch from the Bell team and Front Desk. Zali from the Bell was excellent and welcoming, suggested places to go for my wife to bring my 2 kids while i queued up. Drinks were also served to those in the queue which was a nice gesture. Chin at the Reception is a great professional, she was calm and displayed great warmth during my check in despite the overwhelming pressure from other guest. On the day of checkout, we had a nice chat with Ibrahim who was very friendly and we told him how much my family enjoyed our stay. As this is their first weekend opening up for Staycation, I trust the Management will improve on the guest arrival experience, perhaps opening up a function room or a waiting area on a different floor.

Downside: Kettle was faulty and there were ants coming into our room from god knows where (suspect the plants outside the windows).

A lady called me personally the night before to inform me that i would be able to check in early. Initially i had a birthday surprise going on and it was all ruined no thanks to the hotel. The second incident was i was promised a cake and refreshments in my room but there was nothing in the room at all. Called the management and they said to get back to me ASAP. They only got me back to me after i called AGAIN at 7pm. I only received my refreshements and cake at 8.30pm AT NIGHT. Third incident was the CLUB LOUNGE. The lady, Serene, offered me a seating area with no views at all. She told me there were no more seats left hence she could only offer me those seats. But clearly they WERE EMPTY SEATS around the whole club lounge. We reached the club lounge at 6pm. We ordered the drinks and waited for the food to arrive. Beside us was a group of 4 Americans that ARRIVED after us. They ordered after us and Serene immediately made the drinks for them and served them their food while my fiancé and I waited, for 45mins?! She ignored us when we tried to get her attention and my fiancé had to walk right up to her just to order 2 damn drinks. After waiting for a good damn 20 mins, my fiancé left the club lounge in anger. I did not pay an amount of 500 just to get this treatment from the hotel. The hotel manager Candy, finally called us at 8pm (after our 1st call at 3pm) and apologized for everything. She did offered a late check out and 2 sets of free dinner but our moods were already badly ruined that night. The hotel did not offer any other compensations and honestly speaking I am still very very upset with the service. It was supposed to be a wonderful staycation but things just kept piling up and it was just A REALLY BAD EXPERIENCE. The manager Candy also mentioned that the hotel did not expect the huge amount of customers coming in which explains the service - But in my opinion, I paid for it so I feel that I should have gotten what ive paid for. And also, when you have an offer on the hotel how could you not expect a lot of customers coming in? It is also the hotel's issue to fix and not use it as an excuse. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. I hope you can look into this matter and ensure that no other customers would have such an awful staycation ever again. I am honestly very traumatised by this and would NOT come back to the hotel again.",Date of stay: November 2020,,1,,,,,,,,Chinatown,,

We waited in the lobby for an hour whilst our room was being cleaned and the manager only came to speak to us after being requested numerous times.
This service level set the standard for the rest of our stay... waiting an hour for an ice bucket to be delivered to our room and an hour for breakfast on Sunday morning. Something just seemed to be very wrong with the service.

The property itself is beautiful and very clean. We thoroughly enjoyed the guest room and amenities as well as the restaurant and lobby bar. Every staff member we encountered was warm and welcoming and all were very accommodating. However, a few of the bellmen there went above and beyond for us and we would like to personally thank each of them.
We were traveling on our honeymoon and as frequent travelers, we often like to talk to the local staff to get suggestions and ideas for things to do. The three gentleman working as bellmen over the days we were staying were extremely helpful to us throughout our entire stay. Daily, they would offer suggestions and engage in conversation, they genuinely seemed to care about the experiences we had while visiting.
On the last day of our stay, we were talking with the bellmen and one told us the story of how he was from Malaysia but he now lived in Singapore. After further conversation, we learned that there were actually several workers who lived in Malaysia and worked in Singapore. We mentioned that we had not been to Malaysia and not only did they offer to give us detailed instruction on how to get there but one of them who was just getting off of work was actually on his way back to Malaysia and offered to show us the way.
Not only did he allow us to travel with him back to Malaysia, he actually escorted us and ended up showing us around his country. He spent a good part of the evening with us and ended up being our personal tour guide. It was an added bonus to our honeymoon and vacation that we will never forget!

The welcome drinks -- the lobby bar's non-alcoholic signature cocktail -- while we were checking in were a great omen for this exceptional stay. The service was excellent, and the front desk was always available for any of our needs at all times during our stay.
The architecture of the hotel and the design of the rooms is amazing. It is very puristic and stylish, but equally warm and comfortable. We had a deluxe room. The height of the ceiling was far beyond average and contributed to the room's spaciousness. The bed was big and comfortable. We loved the big windows (up to the ceiling) and the fact that the room was equipped with both night and day blinds (to be shut electronically of course). We also liked the wooden décor of the room with built-in furniture a lot. The only downside was that there should be a few more drawers or built-in cabinets.
Another positive aspect was the water pressure in the shower. While many hotels obviously have a problem with decent water pressure, we were pleasantly surprised this hotel was a great exception.
Internet connection, particularly for the laptop with an Ethernet cable, was delightfully fast. The WiFi (including the WiFi calling option for our cells) was not always available at the best signal strength in every corner of the room, but the very fast Ethernet cable connection for the notebook definitely made up for that.
The bathrobes the hotel provided for us in the room were very welcome.
The breakfast buffet offered an incredible abundance of Asian and European as well as North American varieties of all sorts -- very delicious, and the atmosphere in the stylish restaurant is superb.
A big thanks to the staff for the fruit basket and chocolates they sent up to our room to congratulate on our wedding and honeymoon. Very sweet!
All in all, it was a perfect stay -- just unforgettable.",Date of stay: February 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Chinatown,,

We went to celebrate our anniversary and the hotel impressed with a special dessert and a personalised card. We were also given an upgrade to the superior room.
Remember to book a club room. The club lounge has breathtaking views of the vicinity and is exceptionally beautiful in the evening. The food served during the cocktail hour is really nice. Make sure you try the fresh octopus salad.
Of all the staff, one really stood out, Serene from the front office. She provided warm and friendly service. Not only that, she remembered it was our anniversary and even offered us complimentary use of the club lounge after we checked out.

It was a most relaxing and enjoyable visit both times. The staff on Reception checked us in quickly, and were welcoming and helpful all through our stay, one even took time to fully explain the MRT system, which is conveniently close to the hotel, and a quick and easy way to travel around. Singapore is ""greening"" the city as much as possible and the Park Royal is leading the way with cascades of greenery falling from every balcony. These plants are nurtured by the staff in an efficient, but unobtrusive way.
We had a very comfortable room on the 13th floor with amazing views. It was immaculate throughout our stay, 4 nights each visit. We had opted for the more expensive rooms, as they offered use of the Orchid Room on the 16th floor for breakfast and drinks and canapes in the evening from 18.00 to 20.00. This in fact proved a real plus. In reality, a light supper was provided with copious amounts of wine , beer or cocktails. The service was impeccable and I must mention Sylvia, the main chef there, who went out of her way to suggest combinations of salads and sushi, as well as offering a hot supper dish. She added greatly to the atmosphere in the Orchid Room.
I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel, and would choose it for any future visits to Singapore.",Date of stay: February 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Chinatown,,

I booked a Executive Suite, requesting the top floor when booking 3 months prior via booking d.t c:m, believing we would stay in amazing luxury. I paid big money for the room, over SGD$750/night. I knew of other Park Royals were the billionaires stayed, so why not this one. $750 I thought would be a bargain.
On arrival, our greeting was cold, and upon finally reaching the reception desk, it warmed with a tea drink. Great I thought, now our hostess will take us of the the executive bar for special service.... Errr - nope. Your on the the corner on the 14th floor and you can find your own way there! The relationship with customer service was severed right there - minus 1 star.
We found the room ok, not quite as large as I expected but comfortable. Jumped into the lounge and turned on the TV to catch up on local region news. Nope. CNN and BBC dominated, the ABC from Australia was all stretched and looked analog. Maybe bootlegged off a satellite or internet stream I felt. Omg I could watch better quality on my phone! Minus 1 star
The bed was great, the linen of high quality and the ability to control the room temperature and window privacy was excellent. If I wanted a good bed and window control, I’m sure I could obtain elsewhere at a 1/3rd of the price per night.
The bathroom was roomy, with excellent sink area, the shower great and the minister of all affairs informing me the bath tub could be much better. The toilet was separate with lockable doors.
However on closure inspection of the floor tiling in the bathroom and toilet, I found areas were the grouting was completely missing, and you could shine light down under the tile floor. One of these areas was the foot area in front of the toilet. Omg I thought, that’s a classic haven for bacterial growth, it’s ideal. Continued inspection of the room found rubber sealing out of place in the shower area, again not able to be cleaned suitably. Minus 1 star
Would I stay again you might ask? Nope! Not whilst in that condition and lack of services. It’s only a 4 star hotel currently.
We left the hotel, choosing not to extend our stay there, and headed to an equivalent 5 star rated hotel, that has so far turned well beyond our reasonable expectations. Blown away. And guess what, it’s cheaper!
So shop around and don’t be afraid to take up on the additional cancellation policy.",Date of stay: February 2020,,1,,,,,,,,Chinatown,,

The seperate living room area was spacious and comfy enough to do some work on my laptop. The room service I had, Wagyu Burger, was great as well.
I was so impressed by Sean / Scully who prepared a chocolate box, champagne and a hand written card delivered in the evening! This is over and beyond any other gifts I've gotten over other hotel staycations for special celebrations. Koodos to Sean and his team for making it such a memorable stay.
The Club Lounge was okay. Food was decent, particular enjoyed the chefs cooking during evening cocktails. Some areas to improve on but I believe the team can work out the kinks to become a great club team. Didn't manage to try out the restaurant Lime but will be back for more!

However, the service from the staff was the killer blow. He was very friendly and nice throughout our dinner. Even before I came here, I called in to make a reservation and would like to have a better seats as I'm celebrating my anniversary. They even gave me a cake with a chocolate bar with the word ""Happy Anniversary"" written on it.
I would recommend to come here if you are a fan of seafood. It's fresh and portion is great.

Even up till the moment she left, she did provide us reassurance on what we were promised and we were handed over to the next sales coordinator in a proper manner.
Andrea appeared to be very young and lively but we were worried that she was not experienced enough at the beginning. But our fears were slowly replaced by assurance as she was detailed meticulous and responsive to our queries, gave us timely reminders leading up to our big day. She was there at every juncture and took note of all my requests, and even when we were closing up to the actual day, she went through our AD timeline and offered to prepare tea for us for my Tea ceremony at the hotel. On top of that she was there when we had a hell lot of things to bring in the day before my wedding, arrange the bell boy to bring our things up to our room. All done swiftly and our rooms all ready and prepared. Small words of concern and various arrangements to help us tide through this huge event. Im really thankful to have her around, plus she had so many sweet gestures that I really appreciate.
Last but not least, our wedding coordinator Andrew. Before I met him personally, I have already read many good reviews about him online but he was the WOW factor throughout this entire wedding. Before the dinner banquet begin, he was there very early to oversee the staff, making sure things were good, AV and all that to rehearse with my husband. During the cocktail timing, he was there to reconfirm various details and took measures to make sure that we started the dinner on time. Taking into consideration many small details, his service was impeccable and not to mention he was even there to calm me down as I was feeling nervous during the first march in.
Even after the dinner ended, he was there to continue serve drinks to our guests and brought up our food to the room very promptly. I enjoyed the food thoroughly in the comfort of my hotel room, and had a great time with my guests. He was the reason why my guests were well take care of, food was served hot and needs were all met. I can go on and on to praise him but we just want to say a big thank you to Andrew for doing such a great job. He was probably the reason why I can enjoy my wedding dinner properly as he took care of almost everything else. Thank you for the excellent job done as we sincerely appreciate all the help rendered to us on our wedding day.
All in all i had a wonderful experience holding my wedding with PRP hotel and I highly recommend Andrea and Andrew to all couples to make their wedding a smooth and successful one. “",Date of stay: February 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Chinatown,,

The pool gets zero sun and its quite cold (which I like) but because its in a permanently shady area that could be a problem for some.

"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering, Singapore",Bert,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/BertStynen,,Bert wrote a review Feb 2020,1 contribution,Royal accomodation ...,"This review of the ‘Parkroyal on Pickering’ is long overdue, since our stay here was in 2014. I’m not much of a review-writer, but I’ve always wanted to give credit to this wonderful hotel, not only because of the kindness with which we were treated there.
Our stay in the Parkroyal was a prolongation of our cruise with the Crystal Serenity, which then ended in Singapore. I often organize trips for friends, and I had chosen this hotel after careful examination of all the information I could find on first-class hotels in Singapore. Eventually, I chose Parkroyal because of its rare blend of luxury and eco-awareness.
It certainly didn’t disappoint. Arriving at the hotel, we were very impressed by its beautiful façade, which the photographs I had seen cannot convey completely. We had a gracious and swift check-in, and were escorted to one of the nicest rooms I’ve ever had the pleasure to stay in (mind you, I have experienced quite a lot of 5-star hotels). The use of space was excellent - the way the bathroom was integrated in the room was very well thought out (I don’t want to give the impression that we had a small room - au contraire - but clever design is always appreciated), and we had an impressive sight over the city.
We were sorry to only stay here for two nights. Moreover, my wife had the misfortune to become sick the last day of our journey, the day we normally had to check out in the morning. As our flight only departed in the evening, the staff of the Parkroyal were so kind to let her stay in our room for the length of that day, until the moment we had to depart for the airport, and this without an additional charge. I hereby express my gratitude for a level of service that isn’t to be taken for granted, even when staying in a world-renowned luxury hotel.
I’m writing this review on a cruiseboat (again - this time the Seabourn Ovation). Coming from Hong Kong, because of the fear of the Corona-virus, we’ve already been refused to get ashore in the Filippines and Vietnam. Yesterday, at last we were granted access to Thailand (everyone on board is in good health), and within a week we will end our cruise once more in Singapore. Can you guess which hotel we’ll be staying in this time in Singapore? Off course ...
PS: don’t worry about us transferring the virus. When we’ll get at the Parkroyal, the incubation period will have expired (and we’re feeling fit as a whistle).

Our room was amazing with a great view overlooking the park.
The room was just like a room away from home with lovely bathroom ammenities and a Nespresso coffee machine. The beds are very comfortable too .
The breakfast is one of the best we have had on our travels and your staff member Sky was ever so helpful in advising us on must dos whilst in town evey morning as we enjoyed breakfast.
A big thank you to Sky everything he recommended, the kids had a great time !
The hotel is conveniently located in the business district area with Chinatown MRT at the door and Chinatown just around the corner for a great bite to eat.
The pool area with skyline views and day bed bird cages were perfect. We took a walk around the paths that wind around the outside of the hotel which really is amazing having an outside garden growing over the hotel !
The hotel is ever so environmentaly concious. A big tick from our family!

We loved our stay here. The staff were always friendly and even left my mum a birthday treat in our room. The cleaners were also very nice, although ours couldn’t speak much English he was happy to take a photo of my mum and I upon request. The beds were comfortable, the room was clean and pretty spacious.
The only negative was that our mini fridge was really small so we could only fit two or three small 250ml water bottles. That said, it was quite useful having Chinatown so close by so we could pop down for a drink, snack or some more supplies from the grocery store. Also - finishing our day off at the pool was a beautiful way to rest tired feet and we were able to order Singapore Slings at the poolside bar and they even brought them over to us (those were really tasty Singapore Sling’s by the way - highly recommend!)",Date of stay: January 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Chinatown,,

"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering, Singapore",camo72,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/cameronjflint,"Sydney, Australia",camo72 wrote a review Jan 2020,86 contributions,An excellent stay,"Our family of four had booked two rooms (one adult and child in each). On booking I had requested that we be placed in adjacent/adjoining rooms. So - on check in - we were delighted to find out that we were not only in adjacent rooms, but that to make this happen, they had upgraded one of those rooms (to a Junior Suite) free of charge. What a great start to what turned out to be an all-round excellent stay here (of four nights).
The first things we noticed were the amazing plant-lined exterior and the great location. Only a leisurely stroll of 10 minutes to the restaurants and bars of Clarke Quay... even less to the much better (and less-touristy) Boat Quay. In the other direction - again only a few minutes stroll - lies Chinatown, and the plethora of delicious dining options there.
The rooms themselves were perfectly sized and well appointed. We found the beds to be very comfortable and this - coupled with the day/night blinds, making the rooms very dark at night - meant quality sleep for all of us. The showers were both spacious and torrential, and the TV's had a good - if slightly limited - array of channels to view.
The buffet breakfast (downstairs at Lime restaurant) was very good. Omelettes made to order and a wide array of other tasty delights to choose from. One very slight issue was that the both the milk and soy milk used in the cafe lattes was very odd tasting. No big deal - we just ordered long blacks instead, and added the milk from the little jugs on the table - which ended up tasting like a decent, drip-filtered brew.
The infinity pool has a great view of the city and was perfect for our kids. The water itself was crystal clear, but surprisingly cold on getting in (as I suspect it spends most of it's time in the shade of the building itself). No big deal at all, and we adjusted to the temperature quickly and had lovely swims there every day we were there. The kids of course wanted to swim for much longer than the adults. No worries. A Singapore Sling in the deckchairs was the perfect way to kill time, whilst the kiddies splashed about.
The best thing about this hotel though is the customer service. This of course can make or break even the best hotels... but at Parkroyal Collection (on Pickering St) they have this down to a fine art. Always polite and friendly and willing to help. Simply faultless.
A great hotel. We would definitely stay at this hotel again, when back in Singapore.",Date of stay: January 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Chinatown,,

But not as good as I’d expected,"We stayed here for 3 nights in a superior room. The room was a decent size and all wood panelling and not many light fittings which seemed to mean it was permanently dark. Even it’s the blinds open during the day it was dark.
The room servicing was again ok. We had a bath mat for the shower on the first day, but that disappeared and we didn’t get another. Fortunately they forgot to take one of the towels so we used that. The toilet is very dark. You really needed to leave the sliding door open, but couldn’t if you had the blind open as anyone walking down the walkway (external) to rooms could see in.
The included breakfast was quite good, but it did feel like they were struggling to replenish things on day 3, when ironically it seemed least busy.
Coffee and tea making facilities were provided in the room as was bottled water. However, the bottles were glass so you couldn’t take them put with you.
The pool and spa area looked nice although we didn’t get chance to use it.
Location was reasonably good with only a 10minute walk to boat quay where most of the restaurants and bars seemed to be.

"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering, Singapore",Rafflesia,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/Rafflesia,"Perth, Australia",Rafflesia wrote a review Jan 2020,596 contributions,Its a parkroyal,"This hotel has many areas of strength (as consistently reflected through the many positive reviews) and glowing accolades posted. This reflection is no different giving credit where credit is due and also pointing out some quirks associated so that others can make a more informed decision when deciding to stay in this property.
The lounge
I just retreated back into my room at 730 (0730) as the lounge was filling up with guest hungry for breakfast. A brightly lid enclosure, this is a nice place to retreat back into for pre-dinner drinks or after a day of sightseeing for an afternoon snack (its lovely in the afternoon when there is minimal guest). However, as space is a premium, guest after a cozy, intimate environment to chat or simply reflect on the day past, may be disappointed. Also, the tables and chairs opposite the bar area (on the far side) of the lounge are not those of your standard height. Guest with mobility or issues related to the knee best avoid this area.
The real stars on level 16 must surely be the crew who works tirelessly to ensure guest satisfaction. Credit goes to Jen, Kim, Hino, Dahlia and Jun Jun who did an outstanding job for waiting on us during our 3 night stay. You guys are wonderful and make wonderful Ambassadors for your hotel branding. Well done.
The room
The space in our level 14 executive suite is generous. The his and hers wash basin appreciated. While it took some effort to locate & figure out the workings of the electronic switches, we soon got the hang of it. As the buildings are located fairly close to each other, we had to ensure our privacy screens were deployed in the evenings. Guest wanting to wake up to a sunrise view while in bed will be disappointed (unless you want your privacy breached by prying eyes on super early office workers or those pulling an overnighter) next building.
Things which fell short of our personal expectations are those related to the pressure of the rain shower and the fact there was only 1 toilet. The small rectangular shaped design of the shower head allowed one to be drenched. Guest after a cascading rain shower experience may be disappointed. There is also only one toilet (with 2 interconnecting doors) in the suite. I guess we must have been lucky in other properties where premium suites we have stayed in all have 2 toilets with some, even equipped with Japanese style features/gadgets in the main restroom.
The evening housekeeping staff was inconsistent. The turndown service on night 1 was ready by 7 pm but sadly, it was not the case for night 2&3. I had to place a request on connect one at 730pm to both cancel the evening turn down and for our laundry to be returned the next day during the morning service as we wanted to turn in early for the night.
Green credentials
Credit must be given to all the green initiatives undertaken. Congratulations are in order and well done in the visible evidence on display. A step forward for guest who are more environmentally motivated is to provide the option (perhaps through the GHA website) of using smartphones as keys to cut down on the use of plastics and to provide an electronic guest portfolio available through the inroom TV screen of daily messages, bills etc etc) cutting down on the use of paper.
Overall
Other standout individuals worthy of mention include Nelson (front desk) and Tamil (concierge). Thank you for your hospitality which is well appreciated.
Thank you also to ParkRoyal for giving us a taste to the standards one can experience in your “Collection” branding. Its back to Pan Pacific & Kempinski properties in the near future should we decide to stay with GHA properties.",Date of stay: January 2020,,4,,,,,,,,Chinatown,,

"PARKROYAL COLLECTION Pickering, Singapore",syllabletime,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/syllabletime,"New York City, New York",syllabletime wrote a review Jan 2020,11 contributions,Lack of dedication to service,"Facilities: 4.5 stars. Service: 3 stars.
I don't like to leave bad reviews and 3 stars is low for me. But there were just so many instances of lacking, poor, disjointed service that I can't help but see it as a systemic problem. Each instance was small but they really add up when staying there for two weeks.
A few of the instances I can recall:
- The first porter to greet me and take my luggage was obviously fishing for a tip. He's the only hotel staff, and only person in Singapore during my stay for that matter, that seemed to be trying to get a tip. I had a single piece of luggage and having the porter bring it up to the room and set it up was unnecessary and not done in the spirit of service (as some hotels do even when the guest doesn't require it), but instead in the hopes of getting a tip.
- Given free lemonade while checking in. Ok great, but how about asking first? I didn't want a sugary drink and would have declined it or requested water instead.
- While checking in, I was asked to put a deposit down for incidental charges and told I couldn't use my debit card (because it's debit and not credit). I haven't had that debit-vs-credit issue at a hotel in 10 years. I just paid S$8,000+ with that debit card for the room charges but I can't use it for incidentals? Doesn't make sense.
- When I extended my stay later on, I *was* able to use my debit card for incidentals. Using the debit card was the default like it is at every other hotel, no problem at all. The first staff member was apparently uninformed and/or ill-trained.
- I spent many hours at the pool and in the gym (which overlooks the pool). I can say with a great degree of confidence that the average number of staff at the pool deck is zero.
- When I wanted to order drinks at the pool, I went to the little drink stand they have set up. Nobody there. Waited 10 minutes. Wondered if I am supposed to call somebody or something. A manager was walking through and I told him I wanted to order drinks. He muttered ""where is that guy?"" and wandered off. Another 10 minutes later that ""that guy"" shows up hauling trays of glasses, surprised someone was waiting for drinks and obviously not having spoken to the manager.
- Later during my stay I saw the same drinks guy handing out towels, sweeping the pool deck, etc. So even when they do have a staff person at the pool deck it's just one person doing the job of multiple people.
- Ordered room service. Delivered without utensils. Called and asked for utensils. Waited 10 minutes. Had to call back again and I could tell if I hadn't called again they never would have been delivered.
- Ordered muesli with soya milk. Got raisin bran and a 1 liter carton of soya milk. Asked the delivery person if that was muesli and he said ""yes"". Maybe this is a local difference in language? But they have Bircher Muesli as a separate menu item so they obviously know what muesli is and well, it's not raisin bran.
- When I ordered room service the person (helpfully) pointed out I had laundry waiting to be delivered. Yes, I would like it delivered now as well. Was never delivered, had to call back the next day. This was after they ""missed delivery"" twice because I had the privacy sign on, even though the privacy sign was only on one of the two times.
- Housekeeping knocked on the door while the privacy sign was on to ask if I needed housekeeping.
- If the privacy sign is on, they will call multiple times asking if you need housekeeping that day.
- Once while passing a housekeeper in the hallway they asked if I needed service. I said something like ""the privacy sign is off"", in other words: ""yes"". They did not service the room that day. Housekeepers shouldn't need to ask if you want service, just go by what the privacy/make up room lights say.
- Every single time they did housekeeping they would flip off the switch for the power outlet next to the bed. So of course when I plug in my phone I find out later there was no power and my phone hasn't been charging. How to annoy your guests 101.
- On my second day when I went down to breakfast there was a staff member near the podium on his cell phone. I awkwardly waited and considered seating myself. After some time I asked him if I should seat myself and he glances up front his phone and says someone will be with me in a minute and then goes back to his phone.
- Pool closes at 10pm. Not unusual for a hotel, except this is Singapore and it would be great to be able to use the pool after a night out. At least on Friday/Saturday it should be open into the morning. This is especially true considering there is no lifeguard and virtually never any staff on the pool deck, so why not allow it to be open later?
- The pool was way too cold even during the day. I couldn't even stay in for more than 10 minutes it was so cold. Combined with them seemingly skimping on service in so many other areas I can't help but think they just don't want to pay to heat the water.
There were other instances too. It's a shame because the facilities are beautiful. They need a head-to-toe rethink of how they handle service though. Bring in a new manager to set the right tone and get the ship in order, etc.",Date of stay: December 2019,,3,,,,,,,,Chinatown,,

Service was excellent, the staffs are friendly and helpful. The hotel cleanliness is also top notch. The design of the room is very elegant and minimalist, which focus seems to be on more of wooden and eco layout. This design gives a very relaxing feels, especially after a long day of activity.
The breakfast is amazing and has a very good variety. Really amaze by the pick your own herb for your salad counter. The chocolate muffin was really good as well, it filled with a surprise (a very good one, if you like sweet stuff like me).

For a small built lady, they could see I definitely need help without saying.
This is never change since my last stay. This has been mentioned in my tripadvisor comment on my last stay.
I got 1 club rooms and 1 club suite , of which 1 is very dark, and I ask for changes. But your front desk staff has only got I am so sorry, so sorry, can't make it, can't guarantee in their month.
I believe people staying would like to hear something positive or at least showing that you had made some effort. I stay for 3 nights, and even the 1st day cannot make it, I thought the next day can do something. BUT your staff do not make such offer. Even the rollaway bed matter.
I had booked the suite room in 3 persons, but all the way the room setting is just for 2 even toothbrush and everything. I told the front desk, then the next day, they just left us with 6 bath towel. I ask the housekeeping lady why and she said this is what in her file and need to check. Be common sense, stay 3 persons will only provide bath towel??? Is this what I have paid for ??
This time I paid for Club suite and room and this make me even much busy asking this and that. And the communication seems have some problems as well.
I remembered that you used to have an excellent housekeeping team when I stay last time. Where are them this season??
I ask whether the hotel can let me have a cartoon box, of course, the answer is another I am sorry......................... They did NOT want to help in the first instance.
I know you are an environmental hotel, but business is business, people might need to pack for the plane. I normally get this from the hotel when needed.
If you are so environmental enough, you should sell all bottle drinks, no cans, no card. keys ...........
Last but no least, I left the hotel at 3pm, I ask the them to find the taxi, But I don't know why the y don't just get it from the street, we were waiting at least 20 minutes for an off peak hours because they said they make the phone booking. During our waiting, I saw your staff ask the taxi from the street no need to enter the hotel and make us standing there for 20 minutes.
Everyone go for holidays and looking for hassle free stay. I hate keeps hearing your staff saying the word 'I am sorry, sorry,....... not guaranteed......not not not........
Be honest, I was so tired and regret on this stay with your hotel. I do write to the hotel direct and received NO response. Seems they are automatic mute for negative comments. For the services compared to the room charge, it is definitely not worth it.",Date of stay: December 2019,,1,,,,,,,,Chinatown,,

My boyfriend and I booked the Spacation promotion via Fairmont Hotel website to celebrate our 2nd Anniversary last weekend, the offer was really great and definitely for value money. The hotel room amenities were great and view was amazing! Thank you for arranging a cake for us, it was delicious! Also, a special thank you to James for giving us a high floor, an easy and smooth check-in. James also was kind to give us a late check out on our departure date.
The main reason why I booked the promotion is because of the Spa and all the other added on perks! We enjoyed the $150 dining credit however when trying to book for the Spa we were soon disappointed with the service rendered.
We tried to book the Spa for 2 persons during our stay however the staff at the Spa mentioned they were fully booked. Thank you for informing us in advanced. Hence, they offered my boyfriend and I two options which is to either get Spa vouchers or go on 2 separate spa timings.
Of course we did not want to do it separately as it was our special occasion. Your Spa team was kind enough to extend the validity for us for 6 months. However when I e-mail a few times to try and book it is always unavailable and no other alternatives were given. If the Spa is always going to be fully booked perhaps there should be a way that it does not clash with too many “Spacation” guests.
I am still looking at other dates where I am able to book for 2 persons at your reputable Spa.
I hope something can be done. Nonetheless, we enjoyed our stay as your have great food and facilities! Thank you.",Date of stay: November 2020,,3,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

Contact reservation office via email to arrange for an upgrade. Replies are prompt and professional.
Check in was quick & efficient. James at the front desk was helpful. Thank you very much.
I booked an Ambassador Suite.
My first room is 1803. It has a wonderful view of the Marina Bay Sands as per requested. I like the layout of this room. I had invited 4 friends over for a drink (Limited 5 for gathering). The sitting area is just good for 5 person. However some drilling sounds coming from the wall between the bed and the bathroom at around 9.45pm. It went on for about 15min. I called front desk to request for a change of room as I did not want to take risk to have my sleep disturb.
The second room is 2103. It is not good at all. Two very old fashioned arm chairs and a tired looking sofa. The bed facing the work desk. TV is not visible from the bed. A very strange layout. No good vibes. I feedback to the staff, Mike who had escorted me to this room. He promptly informed the duty manager and have her call me. A new room was arranged. Two complimentary drinks were offered as compensation of the inconvenience caused.
The final room is 2218. I like this room the best. A different layout from the first room. Bigger bathroom. But smaller sitting area. This room is perfect staycation for two. Nice & cozy. However if you are going to invite a few friends over, the first room (1803) is a better choice.
Overall, it is slightly above average stay. Room is good but not overwhelming as expected from Fairmont. Bed is super comfy thou. I slept really well. Service prompt but not warm, the main reason why I will not want to come back to again for staycation. Perhaps I’m a local. Perhaps I’m only staying for a night.

No bread/pastries due to current pandemic situation - what has the situation got to do with bread/pastries? If the quality/quantity of a product is compromised, it is not a promotional offer, but a low cost option. Please get the framework sorted out before beating drums about promotional rate for staycation.
A hilarious and alarming feedback from housekeeping when we feedback that the next door guest is having a party with multiple guests which goes on overnight and if that is doable - unless we received complaints from guests, we would not restrict guests going up to room and checks on rooms. If one goes to the extreme to remove bread/pastries from breakfast menu in the current pandemic situation, guests are free to run wild instead?!

I stayed for 2 nights in the Signature King Suite room. The room wasn’t ready when I arrived at 1pm. The reception process our details and told us that they will call us once the room is ready. Despite her effort of being polite and professional, the acrylic panel and mask made it difficult for us to communicate clearly and effectively. Many occasions we would have to repeat ourselves or asked again. I left my luggage with them and went for my lunch. Raffles City has plenty of food to indulge in and you would be spoiled for choice with what to eat and drink. The hotel finally called me at about 3pm and I went back to get the key. There was a bit of queue at the reception and many were trying to check in I guess. I had to wait for quite a bit before I am able to get the keys to my room. The room was pretty spacious and came with 2 balcony for a separate city view which is pretty welcoming. There was a sofa with coffee table and a study desk in the suite. The bathroom came with a bathtub but space wise is a bit small. The bed was pretty comfortable and the pillows were firm which I kind of like. Overall the room is pretty comfortable except that the finishing looks a bit of age. Due to COVID-19, there were no valet service provided during this period and I decide to Grab down to the hotel. The hotel prepared a small cake with a hand written birthday card for my son which I had informed them earlier that I am celebrating for my son’s birthday. An additional bed was also provided for my son. As an Accor member, I was given complimentary drinks as usual but due to COVID-19, we can only have the drink at the pool, Prego or in the room. We opted for room service eventually. Asia Market Cafe also serves alacarte buffet now instead of the usual spread. To assess the gym or pool, reservations are also required to be made based on availability. Things are not the same now with many restrictions and limitations with the COVID-19 Staycation. This is my numerous stay at Fairmont and I will definitely come again once things gets better.",Date of stay: October 2020,,5,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

The stay in the hotel was relaxing and comfortable. However, I would not have written this review if not for the remarkable service from the Front Office Manager, Ms Aiko Pascual.
What I like:
-Room is incredibly clean. I have attached a photograph of the bed to show how welcoming the bed was done. Housekeeper takes pride in her job.
-TV channels suit us and kept us well occupied through the night.
-Being upgraded to the signature suite room #2313.
-Accor benefits of having 2 welcome drinks (despite only being Silver member)
-Ms Aiko Pascual!!! We had a nightmare start as it was meant to be a surprise staycation for my special other half. However, the surprise was totally overlooked and not set up in the room upon arrival. This arrangement was already promised by the Hotel. After checking in, I made 3 attempts to the Hotel for the surprise to be placed in the room secretly. All 3 attempts were overlooked.
I was really upset when I requested for the Duty Manager. Ms Aiko came rather quickly to my room, listen to my concerns and also noted my other requests. She was able to:
1. Deliver my surprise with a bottle of complimentary wine within 15 minutes after we spoke. (That makes me wonder why the rest of the Hotel has no initiative to follow up with this simple request)
2. Dropped me a courtesy call after the surprise was carried out and assist me with breakfast arrangement.
3. Breakfast arrangement was really punctual at 10am.
4. Sincere apology email (not a cut and paste template) sent to me in the morning.
5. Arranged for her colleague (another duty manager) to meet me at checkout.
What can be improved:
-The hot water for the shower tub in room #2313 needs to be checked. When turned to hot and then hotter, the water pressure gets weaker and weaker.
-No special pillow available upon request. We were told by the phone operator that the hotel only has the standard pillow when we asked her for 1 buckwheat and 1 contour pillow.
-No separate shower area. Shower and bathtub are together. The size and layout of the room is spacious, but the bathroom is kind of cramp.",Date of stay: October 2020,,5,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

We first had our room 1803, the view was amazing! It was facing the pool and MBS! We had a small chocolate cake With hand written card delivered after checking into our room! Daily pool time is restricted to 2hrs, which was sufficient. Reservation to be made in advance to prevent disappointment. Staff by the pool bar were friendly and efficient. My son was surprised with a mango popsicle on his birthday! Which he happily finished it in 5minutes!
On our first night we had issue with plumbing/pipe pressure noise for every few minutes. During the day it was once in awhile which we didn’t find it a big issue since we were not resting. It was pretty bad when my son was waken up few times and pointed at the noisy wall to us. Engineer came to check and will require a big maintenance. The return call from front desk was from Royston, manager in charge of the night. He apologised and quickly switched us to another king suite with bigger bathroom on the same level. However the view did disappoint.
I follow up with a call on 2nd evening to check if it’s possible to get a late checkout. I was declined explaining that it’s a weekend and Singaporeans always turn up earlier than the check in time and it’s a full house. Thus I told the operator I had quite a nasty experience the night before and would like to have a late checkout as a service recovery if it’s possible. My call was handed over to Ying, who maybe the in charge during the day. She apologised and explained similar story to me. Instead she asked if we could be offers a 2nd day in-room breakfast since it’s not included. We gladly accepted, as we find it reasonable. To be honest all I wanted was some service recovery from a 5 stars hotel, I’m not trying to be overly demanding here.
Ying told me to inform them our preferred menu for 2 adult and a kid and also give them a specific time for in-room delivery the following day to prevent any disappoint in delay of the food as it’s a weekend. Royston called during his duty to apologise again that he could not speak to be personally earlier on, he checked in on us on our stay and confirmed our order for the following morning. Menu and time was given and food was delivered on time and warm. This to me is impressive from a customer point of view. The inconvenience caused was unpredictable however the team from Fairmont of various department excelled in their service standard to ensure their customers were pleased with the service recovery.
Overall we had a great stay, inclusive of 1 day breakfast and complimentary parking for the entire stay. $100 dining voucher was used for take away from Prego as it was full house and we dined at our own comfort in our room with party decor. $50 returning stay is valid till March 2021.",Date of stay: October 2020,,5,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

The stay has been excellent in every respect. I was pleasantly surprised that my room not only had a balcony but had an amazing views of the skyline as well. The room is designed in a modern manner replete with automated curtains and easy control of lighting at the touch of a button. The bed is extremely comfortable, the bathroom consists of a well-sized bath and rain shower, and the living area contains a beverages / refreshments cabinet with a fresh water faucet.
Furthermore, the room was perfect for working from home, with a desk in one corner and a comfortable lounge sofa in another corner of the room.
Most importantly, the service was impeccable. The SHN team called daily to check in on the well-being of persons serving their stay home notice, and were quick to respond to any amenities requests. The concierge team were also helpful and prompt in delivering any items passed to SHN guests by their families at the concierge on the ground floor.
During my stay, I also had a minor medical issue and the duty manager was on hand to ensure that everything from medicine pickup at the reception to delivery to my room went smoothly.
The little thoughtful touches made the stay more delightful as well. For instance, on Days 7 and 14, SHN guests were treated to a little dessert with a messaging encouraging us to hold on / congratulating us on having completed the stay.
Running the logistics of such an operation must be challenging, especially during the COVID-19 era. I would like to congratulate the Fairmont team on having done an outstanding job, and to express my gratitude for their care and professionalism. I have no doubt in recommending Fairmont to future guests and look forward to being back myself (hopefully in the capacity of a staycation guest!).",Date of stay: October 2020,,5,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

Room is beautiful with separate shower cubicle and bathtub unlike the old design. The bathroom now look bigger with excellent bath experience. Environmentally friendly water dispenser means that you need not boil water or drink from mineral water bottles. Very convenient and easy. Love it!
Not so environment friendly is the use of excessive plastic during gym and spa. The staff wore plastic gloves to handover plastic bag and bath amenities in separate small plastic containers. That means no soap dispensers in spa shower. Hmm... Ok it’s due to the pandemic but this is the only hotel doing these measures. The checkin was also very crowded with Long Queues and with no sofa for your baggages.. so you gotta carry them.

Some pros: The room was renovated and huge. All the room controls were high tech and user friendly - the only negaitve is that in order to turn on the closet area lighting (which is by the entrance and quite dark) you must first turn on the Master switch which then turns on all the lights in the room. Built in water dispenser for cold and hot water very convenient and eco-friendly. The hotel is in a very convenient location above Raffles City Mall and walking distance to many places: Esplanade, Suntec, museums, Capital Piazza, St. Andrew's Cathedral, Funan Mall, Raffles Hotel and Chimes. The MRT is right below to venture further.
Staff were very friendly, especially the gentlemen in top hats manning both hotel entrances. Gym was well equipped. Nice breakfast spread.
Some cons: There is not enough storage space in the closet area especially since one drawer is taken up by the inroom safe. The bathroom is huge and could do with a bench as well as a clothes drying cord in the shower for swimsuits, etc. There is nowhere to hang up wet items. The pool isn't very big given it is shared with Swisshotel and 2 swimming lanes are cordoned off in the middle leaving only small areas on either side for everyone else. If you want to swim/lounge by the pool this might not be a good option for you. If you want a convenient base to head out and explore then this hotel is is perfect.

Amid the Covid-19 situation, our stay had also enriched us in educating our children in How the hotel industry, how the essential workers in hotel industry (even though borders are still not fully opened for tourism yet as I typed) still holding up well to provide an impeccable service.
From dropping our bags, to checking in, to pool check in, to in room dinning services, everything was carefully, patiently, friendly and meticulously done.
Kudos to Norman, our first contact when my husband dropped me off with the boys, he was very friendly and welcoming us throughout our three days in hotel. Greetings from him, good morning, good afternoon and good night, though wearing a mask,you can see his genuine smile. We said our good bye to him after checking out because we have gained a friend in him too. Checking in was a breeze at the reception too.
At the pool, Sasi ( I hope I gotten his name right, my apologies if I didn't) serving us drinks and food and even to the extent that if the boys request any Milo, he would readily make one! Though Milo wasn't a thing in my boys mind, but the friendly and fast services that he has given to us the two afternoon at the pool side was truly recommendable.
Our in room breakfast dinning request via phone. I didn't get her name but she's so patient and her suggestions for my children's menu. Thank you! My boys loved the pan cake and the waffles.
My children have come to understand that things and our way of living are differently since Covid-19. Learning to accept that two hours allocation in pool, to ensure that every other guests get to use the facility, pre booking is a must, pre orders for dinning in room, safe entry check points. This has enable them to see, planning need to done in advance, patience is the key, sharing is a beauty.
Once again thank to the staff of Fairmont and also Uncle James. We are looking forward to the next staycation again very soon.

Everything is as per expected from early check-in to late checkout, recognition of Accor platinum, room upgraded to a suite but at the non renovated old north tower as the south is occupied by stay home notice folks. Room is really clean.
I was also happy as they still remember the bottle of wine that I left during my last stay.
However, one thing disappointing to point out during breakfast at Prego.
I wasn’t very happy when the breakfast order is kind of limited to one order only per person, I ordered the dim sum set and it came with a miserable few pcs of small dim sum and I was told that not allowed to order another bowl of noodle or omelette or pan cakes... not even another cup of coffee espresso or fruit juice.
I understand the alacarte preparation due to Covid-19, but limiting breakfast food seems gone a little too far.
I ended the breakfast session and walked to the shopping mall to buy additional food.

Food - we visited Mikuni’s for lunch which as always was excellent; Antidote for dinner where we had the steak sandwich which was incredible! Also this was more like fine dining than a steak sandwich - no complaints here. Also ordered Room service (chicken tikka sandwich) which was lovely.
Amenities - a lot of the restaurants were closed or limited which, as it was raining, really reduced the options we had and definitely reduced the overall experience. There is no covered smoking area so this was not an option due to the weather - this may be a good element for some, but those who smoke should take note. Also could not book into Prego for dinner as it was booked out until late. We didn’t have the opportunity to visit the pool due to the poor weather. Understand that we are living in tough times but I would have liked it if the specifics around what was and was not open had been communicated to me beforehand.
Service - this is really where we felt let down. Before arrival I tried numerous times to call the hotel to understand if my upgrade request was available but no one answered; room service took 90 minutes to arrive; we then had to call reception to collect the dirty plates etc around lunch the next day as they had not yet been collected; no turn down service; I also mentioned this was a special occasion but this was missed completely by the staff. Everyone we spoke to was courteous and helpful, especially in Antidote, but unfortunately service did not hit the mark. There were also some specifics around Accor membership where discounts were reduced or not offered and the transparency on this needs to be improved.
While we completely understand that it is not easy for hotels in the current climate, service is paramount and needs to be maintained. Overall we enjoyed our stay, driven by the excellent food, which means I will be returning to Mikuni’s and Antidote but would not stay in the hotel again.",Date of stay: September 2020,,3,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

Having access to fresh air for 2 weeks is a real treat.
On top of all the comforts, I have been so warmed by the level of service the hotel is providing. I receive a call from reception every day to ask how I’m feeling, they are always offering to bring me new amenities (coffee pods, shampoo, etc) and they are very accommodating when I request fresh towels. I’ve also ordered some room service meals and, even though I am not seeing anyone face to face during this time, the staff I speak to on the phone are always very helpful and friendly.

It was under the ‘Upsized Staycation Offer’ which included 50% off the 2nd night which was pretty worth it! Do take note though that the rooms available for the staycation are at the North Tower and they have no harbour facing rooms at the moment. The South Tower, with the renovated rooms, are being used for quarantine/SHN (Stay Home Notice).
Early check-in was given at 11am as part of the offer. Check-in was efficient but I was quite disappointed that I did not get to be upgraded to the next tier room (benefit subject to availability even for ALL Gold members?). The room was still spacious, clean and comfortable. Unfortunately, the welcome drinks can only be claimed via room service and can’t be claimed at Antidote anymore due to safe distancing measures.
We still did go for the Antidote Afternoon Tea which is currently by Jaan’s head chef Kirk Westaway. We used the hotel credits for the tea which was good, and I thought it was slightly better than Raffles’ though the ambience at the Grand Lobby was definitely different.
Use of the Willowstream Fitness Centre & Spa required prior booking by phone call (I was wondering why it was done via the app) which I didn’t find difficulty getting slots. As much as I like visiting the Fairmont, it’s fitness Centre and spa really needs a bit of upgrading and refresher. Also, we did encounter some issues with the Fairmont Fit requests. The clothing took a while to arrive and when it finally arrived, it came without the shoes! So we had to call for the shoes again.
Breakfast at Prego is no longer the same as before. The ala carte breakfast is definitely not comparable to the previous buffet breakfast in terms of spread and quality. I liked the Nasi Lemak though! The rest are quite forgettable.
Overall, I did enjoy my stay at Fairmont. The staff are friendly and as much as safe distancing measures are in place, I felt like the human touch is still present.

As I can understand that the hotel is running busy during the long weekend & to avoid massive crowd at the lobby as it was a covid period.I ensure that I went to settle the hotel payment and register all my guest before my stay so that it will be easier not only for my families but also for the hotel. To me Service is about a two way thing not only from the staff but also from the guest towards the staff.
Will definitely stayed here again thank you once again for the memories and stay safe everyone.",Date of stay: August 2020,,5,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

Booked a promotional rate that provided dining credits and a special rate for the second night. Check in was smooth and efficient, and room was spacious and faced the pool. A couple of issues that we had were relating to parking and housekeeping. The stay came with a day’s free parking and the boundary conditions were not communicated at check in but the hotel resolved it very quickly and very well. The second issue related to housekeeping was a little less well resolved. Upon check in we realized that the doorway and also toilet were full of hairs from the previous guest and had not been cleaned very well. We requested for cleaning by housekeeping and left the room for about 6 hours, and upon return it still had not been cleaned and the hairs were still all over the floor. We had to call again and ensure the room was cleaned. Given the Covid situation I think the cleaning is very important for the room and this was perhaps the only slightly disappointing part of the stay. As the staycations have only recently been allowed maybe the hotel is still short handed and needs time to get processes running smoothly.",Date of stay: August 2020,,4,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

However, today, I only passed by this hotel that is linked to Raffles City Shoppjng Centre form its concierge and for some reasons my chauffeur had to pick me up from the hotel driveway.
During this period, I perfectly understand the COVID-19 preventive measures hotels will take. I cooperated with the Tracking App and temperature measurement etc. At the check in area, they asked me about my entry into the hotel and I explained to them only to be stopped by the service manager to be asked a second time why I was going. I told him politely and also let him know that I have already been repeating myself a second time. Then as my back was hurting and it would take another 5 minutes of wait for my chauffeur to arrive, I took a seat at the lobby seeing that there was not really anyone except another lady who was seated diagonally opposite me about 3 metres away.
This service manager approached me a 3rd time and was very curt to question me if I was dining in the hotel and I replied “no” but would be leaving soon when my chauffeur arrives in another few minutes. He confronted me to say that the hotel has a maximum capacity to follow. So I asked, “Are you chasing me out ?” and he replied “Yes”. I was very taken aback and I told him that he could do his job and I understand. However, he need not have to be rude because after all, locals do support our hotels and patronise it frequently just that I was only transiting the hotel this time. He could have said nicely, “No, madam. I hope you understand that we always welcome you but we do have very strict measures from the government to observe here in our hotel. I would really appreciate your understanding!” This would have won my respect for the high service standards your staff would hold regardless of the times we are in.
I would have not taken this to writing if he would have handled this sensitively and politely. For such sensitive measures in keeping up with the government’s measures while getting cooperation from even passing “guests” - as anyone who steps into the hotel property would be one, a good flair in guest relations is pertinent.
Please train your managers. They are representative of your hotel and this is a huge letdown on your reputable image as a great service-oriented hotel. Certainly, you don’t need to resort to “chase” a guest out of the lobby especially when she is fully cooperative and was facing some medical back issues. Being rigid and curt certainly wouldn’t project your hotel to be hospitable. As a result, even after this pandemic, I would hesitate to be a guest there.",Date of stay: June 2020,,1,,,,,,,,City Hall,,

The adjacent shopping mall was very handy and so is a quick stroll across the street to the Long Bar at Raffles hotel. A nice walk to the waterfront and to the Gardens by the Bay, various museums . Short cab trip to the Zoo and to and from the airport. The pool was nice and there was a second pool for children, so one area was peaceful. I will definitely be back on next trip to Singapore.

However, this stay was such a let down!
What used to have been:
- carpeted flooring along the corridors
- carpeted flooring in the room
- premium service in club lounge with no waiting time
- wide selection of food in club lounge 5 times a day
- well decorated hotel lobby, lift and feature areas.
What it is now:
- vinyl flooring in corridors which make the hallways very echoey. so much so I can hear people chatting and walking past my room.
- vinyl flooring in the room which makes it feel like we are staying in a bare minimal hotel.
- busy crowded club lounge, longer waiting time during breakfast & dinner
- severely understaffed in club lounge. they used to be able to see and attend to your every need. but now, its hard to ask for an order where 2 couples are in queue, 2 tables are waiting to order, 2 tables are waiting for food and 2 tables are waiting for additional requests
- selection of food is limited. used to have a small nut n dried fruit selection, small sweet section - ALL THESE ARE GONE.
- zero flower arrangements /ikebana styled arrangements in the lifts or at featured places. now you see empty nooks, a table sitting lonely by itself.
Overall, the place lacks a sense of personal.
Not a place that we will be coming back to for a long while.",Date of stay: November 2020,,2,,,,,,,,Little India,,

OFH is definitely a hotel with the aim of making it your second home. One that stands out from all the big names in the hotel industry.
The whole experience started with Mr Tommy Liew who welcomed us with warm hospitality and the extra mile he takes to remember our names and asked if we are okay when he does his rounds. He gave a very detailed brief and overview of the facilities of the hotel and gave us tips to avoid the crowded period for facilities. This definitely comes with great professionalism and passion. Even though, this the first time in OFH, we felt really comfortable. The tailored approached made us felt special and welcomed.
The hospitality and impeccable service continues from the seamless check in to the skyline lounge. We were also impressed by the service level of Mr Malek who showed us great care and made us feel at home. He goes on the extra mile to ensure we are enjoying out stay there and have all our needs taken care of even during peak periods.
Facilities (swimming pool and 24/7 gym) were well maintained and well sanitized. High sanitary standards which made us feel safe despite the current pandemic situation. As the pool is huge, social distancing can still be well maintained and it is much easier to enjoy the facilities compared to other hotels where the facilities are smaller and thus a lower limit due to space constraints.
Rooms were comfortable, spacious and allowed us to fully relax. The super comfy bed definitely gave us a good recharge. Clean and modern rooms.
The Skyline Room promotional package is a great deal and worth checking out when planning for a staycation during this period.
It’s definitely a hotel great for staycation with friends, family, couples or even for a business stay. This is a hotel that we will definitely return. It is only a pity that we were not aware of this hotel much earlier. The service level of this hotel should be taken as a benchmark.",Date of stay: October 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Little India,,

One Farrer Hotel had a very great location next to the MRT station and shopping mall. There are heaps of eateries and cafes nearby.
Our room was huge and it commanded a fantastic view of the city. Hotel was very quiet during my stay in October 2020 with few guests around. Our twin room was comfortable with the usual room amenities.

Except an initial mishap upon our arrival at the actual rooms given. We are returning guests at the Skyline, we were surprised that the room is different from the usual rooms they used to give us. They were fully booked and provided us with smaller rooms, not the usual rooms that we used to have so that was really disappointing. I wish they could have explained to us before on the room differences since we have been here for several times already. I hope this can be prevented in the future.
However the manager, Patrick has helped to iron out this mishap and managed to change/upgrade 1 out of 3 rooms to a bigger room. Again, I'd like to thank Patrick and the Skyline staff Malek, Joni, Guna in ensuring that our stay will be as pleasant as the previous ones.

Thankfully, it was not as bad as expected (no long queues at the Skyline lounge/gym). There were definitely some changes such as lesser food selection, closing of Skyline check-in counter and gym but it is nothing too major as there is still the main check-in and gym on the lower floors. However, one suggestion is that such changes (e.g. due to Covid 19) could be stated more explicitly on the website so that guests will be more informed. Nevertheless, what led to our second visit is the excellent service by the staff at Skyline lounge I.e. Malek, Guna, Joni and Fadhil. Special mention goes to Malek for always being so sweet and attentive to our needs. We were previously served by Malek during our first stay and his service left a sweet note which resulted in our return. It is definitely not easy for them as their workload increased due to the Covid 19 measures but he is constantly smiling and friendly and thoughtful as always.

Special shoutout to the lounge team of making us (guest), comfortable with light snacks and drinks while waiting for our room to be ready. We were greeted and introduced to the different amenities by Maliek from the lounge team. He asked questions only to understand how he and the hotel could service us. He made us feel super welcome and went the extra mile by slowly explaining the different timing for the lounge and services it provided. It so happened it was my birthday earlier in the week and even the lounge team had known this information by the time I reached the lounge and was greeted with a ""happy birthday"". Moving on to the room, the skyline room has set a new level of expectations for myself, it was comfortable, big, spacious, clean, and had an amazing view of the city skyline. The toilets were superb also. If you are looking for service and a luxurious room. This is the place for you.

We'd stayed in the Skyline room. These showed how thoughtful the room was designed for guests:
- a huge 55"" smart TV
- a comfy Herman Miller desk chair
- a Illy coffee machine in the room
- my favourite TWG tea in the room
- fog less vanity mirror in the bathroom (I have not seen this in any other hotels I've stayed in before. really nice not to have to wipe down the mirror after a shower)
- huge bathtub suitable for tall people
- love the thought that went into ensuring that little things like height and reach of the toilet paper was considered - not too high/low/or at an awkward angle

One Farrer Hotel,Samantha L,https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/Profile/T5281JYsam,,Samantha L wrote a review Sep 2020,1 contribution,Service quality dependent on who is on duty,"When I celebrated my bday here in Aug, service was impeccable. We got a surprise birthday cake. Our requests for more bath towels was done prior to our checkin. Everything was smooth and professional. Housekeeping was professional and respectful.
We decided to come back again one month later for a casual staycay, HOWEVER this staycay has been a nightmare. As a frequent hotel stayer, locally or overseas, I have to say OFH has an inconsistent service quality because this time round, service was lacking.
Firstly, on the first night, we came back to the hotel late and had to shower late. Unfortunately, the water from the bathroom somehow flowed outside of the showering area and to the sink area. The bathroom mat was really wet and we called for the operator to send a housekeeping staff to assist to clean up the excess water. However, operator INSISTED to get their “engineer” to come in to check on the drainage. Although I have reiterated it is not a drainage or plumbing issue, she insisted to send him over. I really didn’t want to trouble so many people as it was already midnight. So engineer came in without taking off his shoes and he confirmed that it was not a drainage issue, and he simply left. The bathroom is still wet, and there was no follow up on my original request for housekeeping to come. I had to call the operator again, and finally, a housekeeping staff arrived, with a small mop and an annoyed face. Well, obviously the small mop couldn’t do anything much, and like the engineer, she didn’t take off her shoes. I think there’s a problem with hygiene in this hotel. Anyway, Housekeeping staff then intended to leave already, with the wet furry bathroom mat. Basically everything was squishy and wet and she had no intention to replace those, until I had to highlight and request for a change. She then went on to replace a new mat for me, with an annoyed face.
2nd day, we left the hotel at 2pm, thus housekeeping was not able to routinely clean our hotel room. Before we left, we went to the front desk to ask a chirpy and cheery staff named Crisha Marquez to help us inform housekeeping to clean up our room and replace the used bathroom towels. Unfortunately, when we returned back at 8pm, the room was not cleaned, bathroom towels were not replaced. We then had to call the operator AGAIN to have new bath towels, toiletry replacements, water bottle replacements. This has been a series of unfortunate events and I will not recommend friends and family to stay here.
If I ever return here for a staycay (maybe not so soon, I’ll take my hotel stays elsewhere for now) please make sure to upkeep your service standards and train your staff on hygiene. Can you imagine waltzing into a wet bathroom with shoes you use to walk everywhere outside? Yes, I am shuddering too.
And everyone should have a service with a smile just like Crisha, please don’t show annoyance and sound annoyed at hotel customers, it’s unprofessional.",Date of stay: September 2020,,1,,,,,,,,Little India,,

It was such a fantastic experience that brought us away from “Singapore”, especially now with COVID-19 & no travel allowed - truly HOME AWAY FROM HOME experience. The service rendered throughout from check-in to check-out was impeccable.
There are so many highlights to my trip. Firstly, the studio room was soooo spacious and the bathroom experience was just beyond! The bathroom fittings were exquisite, from the rain shower and bidet-enabled toilets. The toilet featured a huge mirror - simply wow. Bedding was awesome and heavenly. The two pools were exquisite!! The food phenomenal and varied... they managed well, strictly adhering to Safe Distancing Measures. Sunset Bar’s burger - to die for! Great 1-for-1 promo too!!!
Service rendered by Malek by Skyline Lounge throughout my stay was especially AH-MAY-ZING His personalised service, attention-to-details attitude and jovial personality made our stay all the more merry and joyous! He was extremely accommodating and I must say... MALEK is truly w gem to One Farrer!
Hisham did a great job checking me in, ensuring that all was in order. He was able to provide me clear clarification when I had questions regarding my stay and made me feel safe when I left my luggage at the hotel.
A special mention to Juiu and Crisha for their warm smiles and larger than life personality when assisting with check out and luggage. They helped out with my card when we faced some difficulties.
All this would not have been possible if Sharmila had not ensured that everything was in place prior to my stay and also on the first night- she went on to check it everything was in order for my birthday stay. Personalised service at its finest!
These staff members ought to be recognised as they have contributed to the exclusiveness of this Gem of a Hotel - A true gem right smack in the middle of Little India. Who knew!!! My hope is that One Farrer hotel continues to get its recognition as they made my birthday such a special one... one that will forever be etched in my memory!

We reached out to the hotel, and they offered to honor Agoda's price directly, along with a free upgrade. Brian was very helpful and prompt in responding, he offered early check in at 10am, so that we could enjoy the executive breakfast at the skyline lounge.
Malek & Joni were the main lounge team that assisted us throughout. Malek in particular remembered our preferences in beverages and kept my preferred food items past breakfast to complement my lunch.. Talk about above and beyond!
Unfortunately, there was some minor renovations at the hospital wing, which woke us up on the weekend... But the staff were very apologetic and I guess there must be some emergency fixing required..
The room was clean and very comfortable! We didn't take the upgrade as we preferred a bathtub in the room.
All in all, we're very happy and every dollar well spent. I think we got a very good deal.",Date of stay: July 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Little India,,

Stayed here for 3 nights in March on the way back from Australia. Stayed in a Club Level room with access to the club lounge and we were blown away!
We were met at check in by Patrick, and the welcome we received, made us feel like we were the only guests in the hotel. It was quiet, and just before lock down so Singapore was very quiet. Patrick took time to explain the facilities at the hotel, arranged for our bags to be taken to the room, and explained what was around locally. Every time we saw him at reception throughout our stay, he asked us how our stay was, and was so genuinely interested and attentive.
The Club level room was beautiful. Really spacious, huge bed, lots of room and the bathroom was huge. Mini bar stocked with soft drinks and snacks (all included). We went to the club lounge the first night and we served by Fadhill, who again was really attentive, served us drinks included in happy hour, and again took time to find out what our plans were and made some recommendations. The pool next to the club lounge looked lovely, although we used the main pool on the lower floor which was FAB! Everyone who served us in the club lounge was truly Amazing. They made us feel like we were the only guests there, which sometimes we were. Special mention to Fadhill, Joni & Ng Guna who really looked after us. The happy hour in the club lounge includes beers, wines, and some spirits (G&T, Vodka etc).
The hotel is on top of the metro, so a great location to get around the city, with lots around for food and drinks in the evening.
This has to be one of the best and most memorable hotel stays we've ever had, and that was down to the staff, service, room, club lounge and hotel pool. I wouldn't look at staying anywhere else the next time we visit. We'll certainly be back! Thank you to everyone, and hope you're all staying safe.",Date of stay: March 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Little India,,

After being ushered to my seat, they were attentive to my needs (especially with a 6 months old infant) and even directed my wife to a conducive place for breastfeeding.
In addition, I was also impressed with how the restaurant managed their hygiene in light of the current COVID situation. I feel safe during the whole dinning experience.
I had the flower crab bisque, topside steak (medium rare) and cheng teng. Being a steak lover, I must impress upon the chef's culinary skill to perfect a medium rare steak. Even so for the flower crab bisque, the flavour is well balanced and appealing not only to the taste buds but also for the aesthetic appearance of the dish.
My wife had their mushroom soup, lamb shank and durian salat. Their salat is definitely of fine dinning standard so I wasn't exactly concerned about the pricing. The lamb shank was impressive too, and I thought it's worthwhile to comment that the meat melts in your mouth.
I'm normally not a food critique so it only occured to me and have a short video of their cheng teng. It's definitely not easy bring a hawker dish up to restaurant standard.
Price wise, definitely affordable and great for lunch appointment with colleague or a rendezvous with spouse amidst our hectic lifestyle.
Overall, there's nothing significant I can pick on. I wasn't disappointed and definitely worth my time to pen down my kudos for them.",Date of stay: July 2020,,5,,,,,,,,Little India,,

We actually stayed here back in May 2019 for our honeymoon (trip advisor doesn't let us back date that far, lol). Til this day we still remember our experience and after my photos reminded me of anniversary, I realized that I never wrote the review that they deserved. My husband and I love to travel, and this was one of the best hotels we've ever stayed at. This was our first adventure outside of the US together (we live in Seattle, WA). We chose to stay here for 2 nights, and then Marina Bay for 2 nights, but while we were at Marina Bay--it was luxurious, but all that luxury without the personal service left us regretting that we had checked at out One Farrer.
We still remember the two faces who helped us the most (we hope they still work there, Hasim and Karen). Hasim checked us in and provided us with so much information on things to do in Singapore since it was our first time, and because it was our honeymoon he upgraded us to a very luxurious sweet on the highest floor that they have. My husband and I loved the views. There was lightning (no rain), but almost a daily lightning show every night while we were there and I loved watching it from the lovely window bench, it was very serene. Karen provided us with daily smiles with door service, and also helped us with directions. She was there to help grab our luggages the minute our taxi arrived, and helped us while we checked out.
Hasim was always available to make sure our stay was amazing when we would pass by him in the lobby, and he was also there to see our departure. We cannot rave enough about the level of care/service. It is amazing how fast time flies, and we dream about the day when we can go back. A GREAT BIG THANK YOU AGAIN Hasim and Karen (if you're still working there!) You guys were amazing, and we still think about you guys! And if management is reading, pls give them kudos or a big raise (our fault for not posting this review sooner because we got so much moving homes and dealing with new marriage life). =)
But now for the real low down reviews, this hotel is much smaller, but don't let the size fool you, if you're thinking should I select this hotel or something much more fancy--this one will more than suffice, we still think about our honeymoon til this day. The rooms are beautiful yet simple, it even has a bidet that a much more expensive room at Marina Bay didn't have! The bed is much more comfortable than Marina Bay, and it is SUPER CLEAN, and did I mention the service??? =oP
Sure it doesn't have the bells and whistles of a (crazy crowded) infinity pool, but if you like relaxation, beautiful thought out rooms, and convenience (it's literally steps away from a major shopping complex with food court (which has McDonald's which is fun for us since it provides way different, much better menu items than the US) and also a very convenient MRT station just a block away--you can go anywhere. Little India town is down the street (but we didn't go there), it was no more than 30 mins by MRT to any major attraction in any direction. There is also a 7-11 literally attached to the side of the hotel, small but suffice. Everyone speaks English here, and they take care of you. We also received 2 breakfast voucher, and we went in thinking oh it's going to be your normal eggs, sausage, toast--boy were we wrong! The breakfast buffet was AMAZING, I literally told my husband that I'd definitely even pay for this next time with no voucher! The variety to satisfy international palettes (we are Chinese Americans) was amazing! We love to eat a variety of foods, but having both American//Chinese/Singaporean style foods made us feel right at home. Anyway, if you are even debating, without a doubt, stay here! If you're even debating between Marina Bay and here, I will tell you the difference--that Infiniti pool is the ONLY major experience difference which is an incredible view/experience and full of fancy high end boutique shops if you're into that, but don't expect any service or attention like you get at One Farrer because at Marina Bay, you're just another number because it's so commercialized. The pool at One Farrer is beautiful, just like it's shown on their website photos, but sadly we never got to enjoy it because we didn't have much time, and it was raining in the evenings. Stay Safe everyone & Happy Travels! =)",Date of stay: July 2019,,5,,,,,,,,Little India,,

The view from the hotel room on 12th floor was a fantastic cityscape - night view being the best. Had ordered food from their restaurant and I liked all of it, be it breakfast or some special lunch-dinner dishes. The mini-bar used to be replenished everyday and we never had to call housekeeping for anything. I always like it when the hotel staff takes good care of the guests making sure that each and every minute detail has been taken care of. Contrary to my perception, the Urban den room was spacious enough and could easily accommodate 3 persons (one king bed and one separate bed for 3rd person in the foyer).

It was not a one off bad experience, it was consistently badly organised and inefficient over 3 visits. No complaints about the variety of food on offer but when you have to ask for coffee time and time again until you actually get it, something is very wrong.
Apart from this bad experience, everything else was great. I had a skyline studio room for 4 nights on the 18th floor and it was enormous. If you're a swimmer like me then you should book this hotel on the strength of the massive outdoor 50m pool which is fantastic and was never busy.

The hotel is located on the northern edge of Little India, right above the Farrer Park Metro station. It met all the requirements for a 5 star place to stay. The building was modern, clean, well appointed throughout, all the staff we met were really friendly, and the breakfasts were superb. We started most days with a swim before breakfast and had the Olympic length pool to ourselves. The taxi from the airport dropped us right at the front door on the evening we arrived and we experienced 2 of the best hamburgers we have eaten, anywhere in the world, poolside at the Sunset bar. The room, on the 15th floor, was luxurious, very comfortable king sized bed, quiet with a great bathroom.

I picked this property instead of Grand Hyatt in Orchard (they charge the same price at the time of booking) because it's in my old hood and I miss my morning run around Marina Bay. I was not disappointed. The property and my room was super clean. Hand sanitizers were everywhere in public areas. My service apartment studio was compact but well designed and modern, I got everything I needed for the week (wifi, study desk, nice bathroom, washer cum dryer, microwave, big fridge, and all essential kitchenwares), it's very convenient even though I didn't have to cook. MRT entrance is just a stone away which makes easy commute. Rooftop swimming pool and terrace were open for guests which was a great plus. Most staff were very friendly and helpful.

This hotel is literally 2 minute walk from the Raffles Place MRT. I got there from the airport simply by taking the MRT.
As soon as I entered the building, I was immediately greeted by a friendly lady named Sara (or Sarah?). She helped me with the check in. She was very helpful and informative throughout my entire stay. Whenever I left the hotel or came back from outside, she and the other staff always greeted me and asked me how was my day going. The whole team in general was awesome.
I stayed in the Finlayson suite. this room was HUGE and had all the facilities I needed for a comfortable stay. The bed in particular was super comfortable. The cleaning staff worked hard on keeping my suite clean and organized. Yup, it was pricy, but I honestly wouldn’t pay at least $500 USD per night to stay in basic rooms in 5 star hotels like Ritz Carlton. I think I paid about $270 a night for a 1100 sqft room.
I will deduct one star from the furnitures and the decorations in the room. The furnitures are quite old and so are the decorations in the building. Most of them have scratches and obviously haven’t been remodeled for a while. This wasn’t a show stopper though.
I’ll definitely come back to Ascott Raffles Place next time when I visit Singapore. I really hope this hotel can survive the current COVID-19 crisis.",Date of stay: February 2020,,4,,,,,,,,Raffles,,

Hotel pool on 18th floor is lovely and provides great views of the city through the glass walls of the pool. There is also a balcony near the pool where you can relax and enjoy the view over the Singapore skyline. The pool was my favourite spot, and very refreshing in hot weather.",Date of stay: June 2019,Trip type: Travelled as a couple,5,,,,,,,,Raffles,,

Our one bedroom Brown suite was stylish, clean and spacious, with large bathroom/shower room and it offered an excellent selection of toiletries. The staff were welcoming, friendly and accommodating throughout our stay. The bar and the restaurant serves a good selection of drinks and food and it was great to use their services when we arrived late and tired from the airport. A swimming pool, gym and the lounge area can be found on the 19 floor, which is a great addition to this hotel. The swimming pool is built in glass and is overlooking the harbour and surrounding skyscrapers. The lounge is very handy for a quick coffee/tea, read or just to relax.

There was a generous sized combined living/dining/kitchen area with a full sized fridge, a small cook top and microwave a combined washer/tumble dryer (those things never really dry well but there is a drying rack). There’s good TV with cable and a Bose entertainment system. The free WiFi is fast and reliable.
The apartment was nice and clean with daily servicing. There was no noise from other guests and only a gentle city hum inside the apartment.
Good quality toiletries were supplied as were laundry powder and dishwasher detergent. The bed and bedding were very comfortable and we slept very well. There was a generous walk-in shower and a mid sized bath in the same wet area.
The Hotel is in the financial part of the city and very convenient as a base. There is a hawker food centre 3 mins walk away and China Town is about 800m away. Raffels Place MRT is just outside and there’s always plenty of taxis around. Its just across the Marina from the Marina Bay Sands and Gardens by the Bay a 20 min walk or an MRT trip.

A lovely well equipped spacious room on 9th floor awaited me.
Super comfortable bed, nice shower and bath. Nice shower stuff (shampoo, conditioner, body wash)
Well equipped kitchenette (including washer dryer with supply of wash power.
Separate lounger with decent TV ans Bose sound.
Open air pool on 18th is great (suggest you change in your room though as no lockers (towels provided).
Avoid having breakfast, it is over priced and not very good (a separate company from Ascott Raffles). I bought some breakfast bits (yogurt, juice, milk) from the near by Cold Storage store. The room has a little Nespresso machine and you get a couple of capsules a day plus in the morning there is a big Nespresso in the lobby.

The toilet is one of a kind. It’s gorgeous and it’s big! And the toiletries are all from l’occitane. I can’t help it but took a video. However the room that I gotten has no view at all but a wall from the opposite building so kinda boring. Considering it’s a suite type of room and pricey I expected for a good view. Good thing is we stayed to sleep only. For the design of their swimming pool, it doesn’t attract us to soak from it so we skipped swimming in. There is no breakfast inclusion also.

As you walk out of the hotel there are some restaurants outside, but should you chose to go into town you can use the MRT which is only a 10 minute walk. (The $20 tourist card saved us loads of money on cabs available at certain ticket offices including changi airport ticket office) This hotel is on Stevens road not far from orchard road, so it’s out of the way of all the noise of the city but not too far should you wish to visit the Center.

Seeing that my friend regularly stays at Novotel on Stevens Road, I decided to surprise him with a slice of chocolate cake during his next trip to Singapore two weeks after. I called the cafe located at the lobby area and asked if they could help me arrange it. I was connected with a very lovely lady, Ms Leah Cuering, who not only offered to help me, but went out of her way to make a lovely card herself with my message in it to go along with the cake.

Of course, nothing is perfect. Some room for improvement - local food selection at breakfast buffet could have better quality. Eg Otah-otah should not be too hard.

We were also given special treatment upon arriving with an upgrade to access to the Executive Lounge. That was a really nice surprise. Lily at the checkin desk was professional and welcoming. The staff in the executive lounge were excellent and provided very high touch service. Joshua and Anna greeted us with warmth every day and gave us tips to improve our visit that really did help. And Dahlia - well- she treated us like her own personal guests even packing a small bag of freshly baked cookies and dried fruit snacks for a particularly ambitious sight seeing day.

The pool seems dirty though, maybe it was after a rain... There were many debris in the pool... (E.g.paper, leaves...)
Went for breakfast at around 930am. The dining place was packed but with enough empty seats to fill the guests waiting in line.
Not sure why the staff have to get our room number and make us queue at a second line. Then another staff have to ask the first staff if room number is being taken before ushering guest in the second line to empty seats.

A gentleman named Eloysius (something like that) he led us in. We had been traveling for over 24hrs from Chicago via Hong Kong and we were tired. We knew we were arriving at 6am so we had booked the night prior to guarantee our room for an early arrival. Eloysius Did not even say ‘Good morning’ or ‘Welcome’ he just said ina. Very rude and disinterested tone ‘I need your passports please, the hotels full so we don’t have a room for you now’ ok? How about welcome back, or how was your flight, or maybe just check our booking first to see we paid for the night prior to our arrival. I have met even mentioned that I am an Accor Gold member and there was zero recognition of that. Eventually after I explained we had booked the previous night and emailed the hotel prior to advise them, he miraculously found a free room in a ‘full’ hotel. He then handed us the key with a ‘thanks’. I then said ‘am I getting an arrival welcome drink for my status?’ He said nothing at all and just handed me a voucher and wrote X 2 on it.

Then there is the ubiquitous 7-eleven store within the premises. For those who love Indian food there is a very good Indian restaurant right next to the hotel.
We enjoyed our stay in this friendly and value for money hotel.",Date of stay: December 2019,,5,,,,,,,,Orchard,,

Great hotel with strategic location, free shuttle bus to Orchard Road scheduled every 30 min, spacious sparkling clean Deluxe Room, and surprisingly we were so lucky to be treated as such special guests by Mr. Ash (Abu Bakar from Guest Experience), Ms. Hannah (Front Office), Mr. Sho (Premiere Lounge), Staffs at the Food Exchange Restaurant, Mr. Amir (concierge), and one gentleman (concierge - I'm sorry I can't recall his name) with disability. And with his limitation, he was always there at the Lobby happy to help us with our things everytime we arrived with a taxi and shopping bags. Thank you Sir!
Particularly, our highest appreciation also goes to Ms. Hannah and Mr. Ash who greeted us since day one we arrived on Dec 24th.
We arrived early at the hotel due to morning flight and Ms. Hannah was so kind to arrange early check-in (and also late check-out) for our rooms. While, Mr. Ash did a lot of mindful efforts to make sure our stay is enjoyable and memorable.
To start off, Mr. Ash organized late check-out for our rooms and to our surprise, granted us a complimentary access to the Premier Lounge during our stay. The list goes on with wonderful surprises for my sister's birthday on Dec 26th. From playing a Happy Birthday song in the Lounge, giving her a big homemade strawberry cheese cake to celebrate during our breakfast in the Lounge, to providing special room decoration on her birthday without her knowing.
Everything in Novotel Singapore on Stevens was so perfect; the room, the facilities, the food, and most of all the hospitality of Novotel people (especially when you're in the country that smile & care seem a bit hard to find ;)).
What Mr. Ash did for us was beyond expectation. Can't thank him enough for all the wonderful treatments & surprises, and with this kind of hospitality by heart, we will definitely come back again for more holidays at Novotel Singapore on Stevens. Thanks to Mr. Ash, Ms. Hannah and the team ;). They made our Christmas holiday even more merrier and that's what a hospitality truly means for us.
THANK YOU NOVOTEL SINGAPORE ON STEVENS. You do have a fabulous team on board! Keep up the great work!!",Date of stay: December 2019,,5,,,,,,,,Orchard,,

From the front entrance to the reception to all the staff are so professional and welcoming to all their guest. What I find more interesting is that the duty manager themself takes the time to check up on their guest. Especially being a foreigner it is really important to select a hotel that makes you feel as comfortable as home and I can guarantee this hotel will meet that standard. The rooms are super cozy, it has a shuttle service to orchard road which is fantastic, to me it has exceeded the services of a 5 star hotel.

It’s directly connected to the neighbouring Mercure hotel so we could enjoy 2 area of swimming pools. The infinity pool had a good view of the greenery surrounding the vicinity.
The breakfast was good with all the variety of western/Chinese/Malay/Indian dishes selection available.
The rooms were clean and for new hotels in Singapore, it has decent room size (23sqm) which gives ample space for the kids to roam around in the room. And among the best part was: free minibar!
There are restaurants and 7eleven just outside the hotel. And this hotel is walkable from Orchard area (15mins walk)
They have the shuttle service that drops you off at Orchard DFS Galleria, which they should improve on the queue management and the driver’s service attitude (he sounded grumpy when asking our room numbers)

Also we had to ask a number of times for a 3rd towel. The staff were nice but felt a hierarchical Management style existed and noticed rubbish around the hotel was left for days. Could be better.

The property is located beside a main road – Stevens Road – and surrounded by landed properties and also freehold condo apartments i.e. it’s an area for the relatively more affluent residents on the island. The distance from the property to the start of the Orchard Road stretch – i.e. Scotts Road – is actually walk-able at just under a km, but the hotel is serviced by a hotel shuttle that brings guests to and fro the T Galleria along Scotts Road. The bus runs every 30 minutes or so, and wasn’t crowded in both directions we availed ourselves of the service.
There's complimentary parking, and guests are accorded one complimentary parking coupon per day, so we got two coupons over the 2D1N stay. The basement car park is pretty big and we had no problems finding free lots.
We had a Superior Room, located at the far end of the block and at a mid level. The 25 m² room is average sized, equipped with a double-bed, sofa, standing shower with electronically controlled blinds, ironing facilities, security box, and a mini-bar. The room didn’t feel cramp, and – in part because of the floor we were on, we had a great view of the Orange Grove road area and also a good amount of sunlight.
Morning breakfast – included in our rate – was at the level two restaurant called Food Exchange, and starts at 6:30AM. The quality of items was a hit and miss – e.g. Nasi Lemak was great, otah was mediocre, Mee Rebus gravy was too watery. What was particularly good however was the restaurant itself: its design permitted a great and interrupted view of the area, and the morning sunlight streaming in provided some really nice pictures.
The property is marked as a sort of mixed use development, and there are a couple of restaurants in the the block, including Pappa Rich and Curry Gardenn, with a 7-11 Convenience Store also just around the corner. Pretty convenient if you’re looking for a meal and don’t want it from room service or make the trip down to Orchard Road for it.
In all, this was a comfortable stay and we got our room at a great rate.",Date of stay: November 2019,,5,,,,,,,,Orchard,,

It's a four start hotel that room/service wise is more of a 3 star. The beds sheets were soft and view from room very nice but the hotel itself could use some renovations. The bathroom sink was all scratched up and stained. The water in the sink wouldn't drain so water just sat until I left and house keeping cleaned up. They tell you that room service will take 45 min. I ordered fries and it took quite some time and then arrived lukewarm. Ordered breakfast and the bacon was black. Ended up getting sick from the food. I ended up ordering delivery from outside my following days at the hotel. Ordered fries from McDonalds and they arrived faster and warmer! Overall the hotel staff is nice, the location is great but the hotel itself is kinda dirty in some areas and service is lacking. A great 3 star but a weak four star.",Date of stay: November 2019,,3,,,,,,,,Orchard,,

The previous reviews was furnished by my wife and actually we shared the same sentiments about our stay at this hotel.
Stragically the location of this hotel is a bit way off but fortunately there is a daily shuttle bus that operate from morning to night.
Foods quality is above average and the breakfast selections is quite adequate. Overall it was good and on top of that there is 2 kinds of pool that allow the guests to choose from.
As for the staffs wise this is their strongest strength. Consistency I should say because throughout our stay the staffs had performed constantly good and we are extremely pleased with their working characters and attitudes.
Single pointedly to name a few that always strike in our mind is particularly Reuben, Tarini, Dolyn, Dahlia, Eugene Chow.
Reuben - you are the star performer at the lounge. We are really impressed with your communication skill and your helpfulness.
Tarini - we love the way you listen to your guests when they are talking and the way you reply to them is really good because you make your guests fully convinced with your saying. Thank you for always remembering the steam rice that I always graving for especially during Sunday evening.
Dolyn - thank you so much for your kind assistance and your smile always bring a very positive impact to your guests.
Dahlia - as usual always remain as our all time favourite and once again thank you for everything. Mama Mary will bless you always.
Eugene Chow - you had shown to us what an awesome leader you are. Thank you for being so accommodative to us.
Overall the experience that we had at this hotel is so great till we always looking forward to come back again and again to stay.

Received a welcome note from premier lounge manager in the week prior to check in. Was pleasantly surprised at check in and privileged to be selected guest of day for my 1 day stay 2-3 Nov to celebrate the missus’ birthday. Front Desk and premier lounge team who checked me in were really fantastic and welcoming. (Sorry I didn’t catch their names). As guest of day I received room upgrade (high floor on 902) with level 10 premier lounge access, complimentary free food in mini bar - fantastic! Received a very nice welcome note in my room from the hotel management team as Accor Gold member. Staff on 2 Nov arranged a nice surprise by lavishly decorating my room 902 to celebrate my wife’s birthday. The premier lounge offered salmon sushi for cocktail (nice!) and premier lounge team on 2 Nov even brought my wife a birthday cake, sang her a birthday song during evening cocktail. Very thoughtful gesture from team! Thank you! Housekeeping accommodated our every request for new towels, additional water/shower gel/shampoo etc without complaints. Breakfast for 3+1 pax was delicious. The Singaporean Indian manager (apologies again did not get the name) who served us at the restaurant breakfast was very accommodating. He and the restaurant team made sure my family were well looked after and our needs were taken care of. All in all great service is the word here. You can tell from the experiences I shared here NOVOTEL at Stevens really went out of the way to make sure our stay with our 3 year old daughter was a impeccable. Will definitely be back.

We booked two superior rooms as Accorplus and Vacation Club members for a short stay on our way home from Bali to Australia. On arrival we received upgraded rooms on the Executive Floor which made my birthday and our anniversary so special!
The Executive Level allowed access to the 10th Floor Lounge with breakfast and also nightly drinks/canapés and that was a pleasant surprise which we greatly appreciate.
We have stayed in other Novotels in KL and Australia and Bali but this was a step above in every way.
They provide a regular shuttle bus service to Orchard Road and the hotel is about 10-15 minutes walk from Stevens MRT station allowing easy access to all that Singapore has to offer.
I must make special mention of Ash Abu Bakar who is the Duty Manager who welcomed us to the Premier Lounge and ensures that our stay was memorable and special. His warm greetings were very much appreciated and also his attention to detail. My very good friend suffers from Coeliac Disease (Needs Gluten Free Meals) and Ash and his team made sure that she was able to eat well and in safety too.

We are thankful for the hotel accommodating to our requests but it feels like the room hasn’t been checked in by anyone for quite awhile. I would definitely appreciate if this room was cleaned and checked prior to our arrival. To add on, the fridge wasn’t cold even though we placed our drinks for over a night. Honestly, the outlay of the rooms were amazing but really hope you guys will take action on the cleanliness level.",Date of stay: October 2019,Trip type: Travelled with friends,3,,,,,,,,Orchard,,

It was a little inconvenient because there was no convenience store nearby, but traffic was convenient because there was an Ochard road in a short distance.",Date of stay: September 2019,,5,,,,,,,,Orchard,,

Check in was a bit slow maybe due to lack of staff at the time I checked in. Hotel is very modern and clean. Room was awesome with a view down to the pool. Complimentary shuttle to Orchard Road or walk 10 minutes to Stevens MRT. Variety from buffet could have been better. Otherwise, would highly recommend and will stay here again next visit (depending on price of course).",Date of stay: October 2019,,5,,,,,,,,Orchard,,

In summary, there were multiple errors on the hotel’s part, multiple denials and eventually multiple failed promises. The staff flatly refuse to engage senior management and my 3 requests to speak to the hotel General Manager have been rejected.
To the facts, the receptionist who checked me in didn’t listen to a word I’d said and ignored my request to confirm the room rate. When I did get the answer, it was different to the rate on my booking; however, if I hadn’t persevered, it would have been incorrect.
I ended up speaking to the duty manager who informed me that there was an error in the system.
Regrettably, whilst the manager was talking to me, the receptionist was taking a double deposit off my credit card. Which he then denied.
Finally, hours later, having convinced the duty manager that the double deposit had occurred, I was promised that the hotel would contact their bank. I was left waiting and a different manager came out to inform me that the previous manager had departed. Not to worry, he would now sort it out. I arranged to meet him at 07:50 to get feedback. Needless to say, when I presented myself at reception, he was also not available.
The 3rd manager I spoke to made the same promises as the previous 2 managers. So. 12 hours later, I still have no resolution.
I am now left with no option but to dispute the transactions and, in the absence of any meaningful interaction with a person at the Novotel who can fix this, resort to expressing my frustrations in this way.",Date of stay: October 2019,,1,,,,,,,,Orchard,,

The lady advised us the bar was open to 11pm.
We were both extremely tried and exhausted, got to the bar @ 10.42pm and the bar lady advised the bar was closed, I stated the receptionist said the bar was open until 11pm.
I ordered a Singapore Sling and a Tiger Beer standard glass, on receiving the two modest drinks, the bar person said that will be $42.00 (I said you made a mistake) NO - that is the price!!!
I had intended to order another round after our long flight, however common sense prevailed, and we toddled off to our room. We always try to support the property we stay at - BUT forget it this time.
I recently retired as GM of a 133 room apartment hotel, and I do know the price of cost and expected profit of drinks, BUT $17 for a standard beer, and $25 for a Singapore Sling you have to be kidding.
The room and breakfast were nice.

This was nice to be able to go downstairs and eat something other than room service on those busy nights when work does not stop after leaving the office. No cab ride required to get to Italian, sushi, Indian, wine bar and tapas choices. The room was clean, comfortable and quiet. Nice views from the room and the pool area. Only downside is that the MRT isn't conveniently located but if you are OK with taking a cab or have a car then no worries.",Date of stay: September 2019,,5,,,,,,,,Orchard,,

While it did not create any issues it was not a good look to continuously see these trolleys & no rooms being cleaned. A minor thing hopefully the management will address. It will not stop me staying at this hotel.,Date of stay: October 2019,,4,,,,,,,,Orchard,,

Love the seniors 50% discount @$24.70 per pax and able to enjoy a sufficient buffet spread. Overall ambience is amazing and staff service is excellent.
Buffet spread consist of roast duck/roast pork, pork knuckles, fresh prawns, mussles but unfortunate no salmons. Love their laksa and satay. Good spread of salads/cheese, juices, indian food, cooked chinese food, soups, cakes, ice cream, small portion of sushi which can be improved. Free flow of coffee and tea.
A special thanks to Mr Deep for providing us a complimentary cake when he heard we have someone celebrating birthday this month. Kudos to Elise who is always so cheerful and prompt service to our needs. Also, Sugu who helped us to take some candid photos and bring laughter to us.
We will be back again for your good service and food.
